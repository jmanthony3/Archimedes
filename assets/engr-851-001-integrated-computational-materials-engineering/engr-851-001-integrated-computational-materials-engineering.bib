  abstract = {Integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) uses computational materials science tools within a holistic system in order to accelerate materials development, improve design optimization, and unify design and manufacturing. Increasingly, ICME is the preferred paradigm for design, development, and manufacturing of structural products. Written by one of the world's leading ICME experts, this text delivers a comprehensive, practical introduction to the field, guiding readers through multiscale materials processing modeling and simulation with easy-to-follow explanations and examples. Following an introductory chapter exploring the core concepts and the various disciplines that have contributed to the development of ICME, the text covers the following important topics with their associated length scale bridging methodologies: Macroscale continuum internal state variable plasticity and damage theory and multistage fatigue Mesoscale analysis: continuum theory methods with discrete features and methods Discrete dislocation dynamics simulations Atomistic modeling methods Electronics structures calculations Next, the author provides three chapters dedicated to detailed case studies, including "From Atoms to Autos: A Redesign of a Cadillac Control Arm," that show how the principles and methods of ICME work in practice. The final chapter examines the future of ICME, forecasting the development of new materials and engineering structures with the help of a cyberinfrastructure that has been recently established. Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) for Metals is recommended for both students and professionals in engineering and materials science, providing them with new state-of-the-technology tools for selecting, designing, optimizing, and manufacturing new materials. Instructors who adopt this text for coursework can take advantage of PowerPoint lecture notes, a questions and solutions manual, and tutorials to guide students through the models and codes discussed in the text.},
