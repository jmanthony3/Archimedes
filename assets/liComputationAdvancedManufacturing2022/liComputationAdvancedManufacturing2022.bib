  abstract = {Magnesium, the lightest structural metal, usually exhibits limited ambient plasticity when compressed along its crystallographic c-axis (the ``hard'' orientation of magnesium). Here we report large plasticity in c-axis compression of submicron magnesium single crystal achieved by a dual-stage deformation. We show that when the plastic flow gradually strain-hardens the magnesium crystal to gigapascal level, at which point dislocation mediated plasticity is nearly exhausted, the sample instantly pancakes without fracture, accompanying a conversion of the initial single crystal into multiple grains that roughly share a common rotation axis. Atomic-scale characterization, crystallographic analyses and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the new grains can form via transformation of pyramidal to basal planes. We categorize this grain formation as ``deformation graining''. The formation of new grains rejuvenates massive dislocation slip and deformation twinning to enable large plastic strains.},
