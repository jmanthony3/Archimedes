## Abstract
[[shot-peening]] is a well known process applied to components in order to improve their [[fatigue-resistance]]. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in including the effects of the [[shot-peening]] process in life assessment models since this would allow a reduction in conservatism compared to those in current application. Part 1 of this review dealt with the effects of the [[shot-peening]] process ([[surface-roughness]], [[strain-hardening]] and compressive [[residual-stress]]) and the resulting effect on component [[fatigue-life]]. This part of the review considers how this effect on component [[fatigue-life]] can be incorporated into life assessment modelling approaches with discussion of the relative merits of each approach. The paper concludes with a flow chart demonstrating a possible route for the inclusion of [[shot-peening]] effects within industrial component life assessment frameworks.
