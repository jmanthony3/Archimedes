## Annotations
<!-- \renewcommand{\theequation}{1.\arabic{equation}} -->
In the stress space, material deforms #inelastically in the direction of applied stress increment if net work in increment greater than 0.
Also, establishes #convexity of #dissipation-potential and #normality-rule on #associated #yield-surface.

[Associativity](inelasticity/associativity.md)
: Only the component of the stress increment vector normal to the loading surface is of importance in determine the extent of loading.
It is an assumption of a linear relation between increments of stress and of plastic strain.

## Abstract
Essentially, thermodynamic definitions (1) of work-hardening and of ideally plastic materials are re-employed to remove an unnecessary assumption in the derivatino of the general Mises-Prager plastic potential stress-strain relations. Additional is thus obtained into the significance of yield or loading functions. In particular it is shown that the loading surface or any of the customary yield curves for work-hardening or ideally plastic materials must be convex. The meaning of corners in such curves or vertices in the loading surfaces is discussed with especial reference to problems of uniqueness.
