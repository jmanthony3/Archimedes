## Abstract
[[shot-peening]] is one of the most favored surface treatment processes mostly applied on large-scale engineering components to enhance their fatigue performance. Due to the stochastic nature and the mutual interactions of process parameters and the partially contradictory effects caused on the component's surface (increase in residual stress, [[work-hardening]], and increase in [[surface-roughness]]), there is demand for capable and user-friendly simulation models to support the responsible engineers in developing optimal [[shot-peening]] processes. The present paper contains a user-friendly Finite Element Method-based (#FEM) 2D model covering all major process parameters. Its novelty and scientific breakthrough lie in its capability to consider various size distributions and [[elastoplastic]] material properties of the shots. Therewith, the model is capable to provide insight into the influence of every individual process parameter and their interactions. Despite certain restrictions arising from its 2D nature, the model can be accurately applied for qualitative or comparative studies and processes' assessments to select the most promising one(s) for the further experimental investigations. The model is applied to a high-strength steel grade used for automotive leaf springs considering real shot size distributions. The results reveal that the increase in shot velocity and the impact angle increase the extent of the [[residual-stress]] but also the surface roughness. The usage of [[elastoplastic]] material properties for the shots has been proved crucial to obtain physically reasonable results regarding the component's behavior.
