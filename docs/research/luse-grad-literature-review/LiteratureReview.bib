  abstract = {We report on the observation of real-time-resolved room temperature grain growth in nanocrystalline metals. We find that neither the time evolution of size can be modeled by standard growth theories nor are there any other systems aware to us that manifest a similar growth behaviour. We detect a transition from an initially self-similar slow growth to abnormal grain growth. Its onset seems to be associated with the simultaneous decrease of microstrain with increasing grain size. Abnormal grain growth is considered as a generic feature of nanocrystallinity but is a transient state since we observed in the late stage of coarsening, using orientational imaging microscopy, a monomodal grain size distribution. We empirically find a nonlinear-response-type of growth law which is in agreement with the observed coarsening kinetics.},

It restrains quality variations that may cause premature failure or malfunctioning of the treated part. Despite the role of surface coverage in process quality, a general description and a unique standard method for its practical control and prediction are not yet established. This paper provides a general review of the definitions and requirements of surface coverage, its practical, theoretical and computational evaluation approaches. In the end a statistical study is performed on a coverage estimation method already developed by the authors. The results of the statistical study result in development of a complementary technique for coverage assessment which ensures full coverage with an optimum number of impacts.

First, the idea and implementation details of the developed cellular automata-based computational library allowing the development of digital material representation models within a workflow are presented in the paper. Such an approach provides the desired flexibility in the generation of various digital models of heterogenous microstructures. Therefore, the proposed library is mostly implemented within the object-oriented C + + programming language with the assumption of modularity. In this case, the main part of the application consists of classes and methods, which can be treated like base elements to be inherited and extended in other libraries. Each additional dynamic link library implements particular algorithms for the generation of specific microstructure features in the digital model within the unified data structures that allow the application of the workflow concept. The set of developed libraries and their assumptions are described as case studies to show the capabilities of the presented solution. Finally, examples of practical applications of the developed library in the full-field numerical simulations of complex material deformation are presented at the end of the paper.},

The review found that the developed numerical models coupling finite elements with discrete elements became increasingly mature and showed their advantages in incorporating flow behaviour and randomness of shots. High emphasis must be placed on the constitutive equations of target material where its strain-rate sensitivity, cyclic behaviour and Bauschinger effects are recommended to be incorporated in the numerical material model simultaneously since considering one of them in isolation may lead to unreliable distribution of residual stresses. Furthermore, material hardening is a critical benefit of shot peening; however, it has not received its deserved attention from the existing investigations, neither in simulation nor in optimisation. The study found that intensity and coverage are two critical control parameters recommended to be constraints for optimisation of shot peening. Finally, this work also found that developed heuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithms have recently showed their advantages for searching optimal combinations of peening parameters. It is plausible that in the near future, the synergy of combining these algorithms with approximation models can be expected to gain more attention by researchers.},

A unique aspect of our ISV constitutive model is that grain size and recrystallized volume fraction can be directly included along with its associated rate of change under deformation and time in a coupled manner. The present ISV constitutive model was calibrated to several metals (oxygen-free high conductivity copper, AZ31 magnesium alloy, pure nickel, and 1010 low carbon steel) and geological materials (olivine and clinopyroxene). The model calibration shows good agreement with the experimental stress-strain behavior and average grain size data. Validation of the ISV constitutive model was accomplished by applying complex and history sensitive thermomechanical problems once the model was calibrated: i) sequential transitions of different loading conditions and ii) a multistage tubing process. The history dependence naturally provided by ISVs enabled the present model to effectively capture the complex boundary value problems with changing boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulations were conducted to compare ballistic performance and penetration mechanism of copper (Cu) with four representative grain sizes. Ballistic limit velocities for coarse-grained (CG) copper (grain size {$\approx$} 90 {$\mu$}m), regular copper (grain size {$\approx$} 30 {$\mu$}m), fine-grained (FG) copper (grain size {$\approx$} 890 nm), and ultrafine-grained (UG) copper (grain size {$\approx$} 200 nm) were determined for the first time through the simulations. It was found that the copper with reduced grain size would offer higher strength and better ductility, and therefore renders improved ballistic performance then the CG and regular copper. High speed impact and penetration behavior of the FG and UG copper was also compared with the CG coppers strengthened by nanotwinned (NT) regions. The comparison results showed the impact and penetration resistance of UG copper is comparable to the CG copper strengthened by NT regions with the minimum twin spacing. Therefore, besides the NT regions-strengthened copper, the single phase copper with nanoscale grain size could also be a strong candidate material for better ballistic protection. A computational modeling and simulation framework was proposed for this study, in which Johnson-Cook (JC) constitutive material model is used to predict the plastic deformation of Cu and Ni; JC damage model is to capture the penetration and fragmentation behavior of Cu; Bao-Wierzbicki (B-W) failure criterion defines the material's failure mechanisms; and temperature increase during this adiabatic penetration process is given by the Taylor-Quinney method.},

  abstract = {Shot peening is widely used in automotive and aeronautic industries to improve fatigue life of metallic components. Its beneficial effects are mainly due to the residual stress field caused by the plastic deformation of the near-surface region resulting from multiple shot impacts. It is therefore important to know the values of the induced residual stresses in order to predict the mechanical strength of the peened component, and to know how these stresses vary by changing the shot peening parameters. The problem is that experimental measurement of residual stress is costly and time-consuming, and generally involves semi-destructive techniques. These difficulties make assessment of compressive residual stresses in real (industrial) peened components very challenging. On the contrary, numerical simulation can provide an alternative way to deal with this task. Consequently, several shot peening models have been developed in the literature. Although these models were successfully applied to investigate important physical phenomena encountered in shot peening, their application to assess residual stresses resulting from a real shot peening test is still not within reach. Indeed, due to computation costs and the complexity of the process, they cannot be directly applied to simulate a complete shot peening experiment. Development of a robust methodology allowing these models to properly simulate such an experiment at minimal cost (i.e. using simplifying assumptions) is thus needed. The present paper aims to meet this need. First, a new discrete-continuum coupling model combining the strengths of the existing shot peening models was developed. To avoid expensive computation times, only major shot peening features are included in this model. Then, a comprehensive methodology explaining how this model can be applied to simulate a real shot peening experiment was proposed. To validate the developed model as well as the associated methodology, they were applied to simulate a real shot peening experiment from the literature. Relatively good results were obtained compared to experimental ones, with relatively little computation effort.},

However, the influence of processing parameters on the GS specimens with different stacking fault energies (SFEs) and microstructural evolution during tensile are not very clear. In the present work, GS Cu-Al alloys with different SFEs of 28, 12 and 6~mJ/m2 were prepared by surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) for different processing times. Results revealed that the SFE of 6~mJ/m2 specimen for SMAT 15~min exhibited a superior combination of strength and ductility, which had a significant hetero-deformation induced (HDI) stress originating from the accumulation of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs). Microstructure observations showed that deformation twins in the SFE of 6~mJ/m2 specimens formed in the gradient layer owing to its lower SFE. Moreover, in-situ electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) revealed that the GNDs of the SFE of 6~mJ/m2 specimen initially formed at the grain boundaries with gradient grain size. Then, the formation of GNDs gradually migrated to the coarse grain region with increasing strain, which resulted in the HDI strain hardening and HDI stress strengthening. This work provide strategies to optimize properties and an understanding of deformation mechanisms in the GS materials during tensile test.},

The first is featured with coarse-grained lamellae embedded in a matrix consisting of a very high density of dislocation structures.

The second type of heterostructures exhibits better strength and ductility, although it has a smaller average grain size than the first type. The zone boundaries in the second type of heterostructures are less prone to cracking than those in the first type. Intersecting micro-shearbands formed net-like patterns in the second type of heterostructures during tensile deformation. This is the first ever observation of structural micro-shear-bands in a heterostructured material. It supports the claim that heterostructure promotes the formation of dispersive shear bands. In contrast, a macroscopic shear band formed and caused early failure of the sample with the first type of heterostructures. Our results indicate that well-developed ultrafine/nano grained matrix in heterostructured materials are necessary for preventing crack formation and shear band localization.

The results indicated that conventional shot peening led to a gradient nanostructured Mg-8Gd-3Y alloy with a size of 60\textendash 100~nm~at the top surface layer. The formation of nanograins was primarily ascribed to the dynamic rotation recrystallization. Compared with conventional shot peening, stress shot peening significantly improved the residual stress distribution with a maximum value of -215 MPa and the affected depth. In parallel, stress shot peening conferred superior microstructures at the deformation layer, with smaller domain size, more severe lattice distortion and higher-density dislocations. Owing to inducing finer microstructures and higher compressive residual stresses, stress shot peening produced a stiffer deformation layer. It is concluded that stress shot peening was more potent in promoting the surface layer characteristics of nanostructured Mg-8Gd-3Y alloy than conventional shot peening.},

  abstract = {Shot peening is one of the most favored surface treatment processes mostly applied on large-scale engineering components to enhance their fatigue performance. Due to the stochastic nature and the mutual interactions of process parameters and the partially contradictory effects caused on the component's surface (increase in residual stress, work-hardening, and increase in roughness), there is demand for capable and user-friendly simulation models to support the responsible engineers in developing optimal shot-peening processes. The present paper contains a user-friendly Finite Element Method-based 2D model covering all major process parameters. Its novelty and scientific breakthrough lie in its capability to consider various size distributions and elastoplastic material properties of the shots. Therewith, the model is capable to provide insight into the influence of every individual process parameter and their interactions. Despite certain restrictions arising from its 2D nature, the model can be accurately applied for qualitative or comparative studies and processes' assessments to select the most promising one(s) for the further experimental investigations. The model is applied to a high-strength steel grade used for automotive leaf springs considering real shot size distributions. The results reveal that the increase in shot velocity and the impact angle increase the extent of the residual stresses but also the surface roughness. The usage of elastoplastic material properties for the shots has been proved crucial to obtain physically reasonable results regarding the component's behavior.},

The first one, the so-called bending deflection method calls for measurement while machining away successive layers of metals. Its simplicity of use and its numerous potential applications in industry make it a valuable procedure for the engineer. Its sensitivity allows accurate determination of the stress gradient change under the influence of minor modifications in treatment conditions. The second one, the so-called stress source method, involves modeling the residual stress formation phenomena. For the case of shot peening, the model developed at CETIM made it possible to establish simple formulas for the calculation of the maximum stress and the surface stress with a good approximation. Based on these formulas, charts have been plotted which allow the direct determination of these stresses from measurements of the deflection of the specimen after short-peening and the depth of the plastically deformed layer of metal.},

  abstract = {Shot-peening is a cold working process which allow to increase the resistance of materials and parts against fatigue, fretting, stress corrosion cracking and other mechanical and conjoint mechanical and chemical behaviours. It is largely used in the mechanical and aeronautical industry. The technique consists of propelling at high speed small beads of particles (on steel, cast iron, glass or ceramics) against the part to be treated. The size of the beads can vary from 0.1 to 1.3 mm. The main advantage of this particular surface treatment is that it increases the fatigue life of mechanical parts subjected to dynamic stresses by generating compressive residual stresses on the surface of the material. Industrial parts such as helical springs, rockers, welded joints, propeller, blades and other aircraft parts, transmission shafts torsion bars etc. are always shot peend. At a time when optimum characteristics are being demanded of mechanical components and structures, shot-peening is being increasingly chosen by engineers to meet such demand. Therefore it is necessary to know the effect of the technological parameters of shot-peening upon the fatigue influencing parameters such as surface roughness, residual stresses and the work hardened depth.},

  abstract = {A variety of severe plastic deformation (SPD) techniques have been developed to process materials to high strains and impart microstructural refinement. High pressure torsion (HPT) is one technique that imparts inhomogeneous strain to process discs with low strain in the center and high strain at the outer edge. In the literature, this inhomogeneity is typically ignored when characterizing wear properties after HPT. In this work, the wear rate of pure copper discs processed by HPT was characterized by conducting dry sliding reciprocating wear tests at a few judicious locations on the discs. From only two discs, the wear resistance across many ranges of strains was captured. These measurements agreed with the literature for other SPD processes at varying strains. Wear rates dropped and plateaued at about 25\% that of the unprocessed state when processing past equivalent strains of around 15, after which microstructural and microhardness saturation has also been observed. Some indication of a relationship between the direction of the imposed SPD shearing and the sliding wear direction was also observed. The incremental microstructure, microhardness, and wear resistance evolution past equivalent strains of \textasciitilde 15 indicate that for high purity copper these properties receive no clear benefit from higher SPD strains.},

Monolithic metallic plates have been the preferred choice for armours against high-velocity projectiles. High-strength steel is a popular choice for such systems. However, the high areal density deters in accommodating such systems in practical applications which require lightweight products. On the contrary, multi-metallic systems produced by the combination of low-density materials with similar or superior ballistic resistance as their monolithic counterparts have become attractive candidates in defence applications. However, only a limited number of comprehensive studies on the ballistic performance of multi-metal multi-layered targets are available in the literature. Moreover, these studies have drawn contradictory conclusions on the optimum arrangement of different layers and materials within the systems. In addition, existing knowledge in this area is scattered in the literature and there is a need to collate them to enhance the development of multi-metal multi-layered ballistic-resistant plate systems in order to be optimised for ballistic-related armour. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the effect of different metals, thickness, fracture mechanisms, feasibility of the connection types and the order of the metallic plates within targets on the ballistic performance.},

  abstract = {The presence of a gradient layer with an increased maximum microhardness and extended thickness is extremely attractive because it can enhance the service performances for surface-strengthened metallic materials. In this research, Cu-Al alloys with different Al contents and microstructures were processed by surface spinning strengthening (3S) and studies were conducted to examine the gradient microstructure and microhardness distributions of the 3S Cu-Al alloys. The experimental results show that each group of the 3S Cu-Al alloys having the same Al content has approximately the same maximum microhardness at the topmost surface layer and the maximum microhardness increases with an increase in the Al content. In addition, the thickness of the gradient layer in the 3S Cu-Al alloys increases with a decrease of yield strength and an increase in the work-hardening exponent, respectively. The relationship between the maximum microhardness and chemical composition which determines the Young's modulus and plastic deformation mode, and the relationship between the thickness of the gradient layer and the microstructure which governs the strength and work-hardening capacity, were both investigated. It is found that the maximum microhardness of the gradient layer depends mainly on the chemical composition; whereas the thickness of the gradient layer depends primarily on both the strength and work-hardening capacity which are closely related to the microstructure. By combining the compositional design and microstructure optimization of the materials, and improving the surface strengthening intensity, a gradient layer of the surface-strengthened materials with an enhanced maximum microhardness and an extended thickness may be achieved.},

By varying the grain size between 5 and 50 nanometers, we show that the flow stress and thus the strength exhibit a maximum at a grain size of 10 to 15 nanometers. This maximum is because of a shift in the microscopic deformation mechanism from dislocation-mediated plasticity in the coarse-grained material to grain boundary sliding in the nanocrystalline region. The simulations allow us to observe the mechanisms behind the grain-size dependence of the strength of polycrystalline metals.}

The first group of models deals with the dynamic shot behavior during shot peening or its related processes and is commonly known as Particle Dynamics Simulation. The second and largest group addresses the quantitative description and prediction of the deformation processes and the residual stress development during a single and/or multiple particle impact. This group of models can be separated in the analytical models, which are based on the fundamental approach of Hertz, and numerical models, such as the Finite-Element method, which has become the method of choice in recent years.},

The improvement in mechanical properties such as surface hardness, fatigue strength, tensile strength, damping etc. are due to the induction of compressive residual stress in the metal parts. The residual compressive stress induced by shot peening is the function of material and mechanical conditions. Its beneficial effects are mainly due to the residual stress field caused by the plastic deformation of the surface layer of material resulting from multiple impacts of the shot, although strain hardening and grain distortion caused by the multiple impacts of the shot also play a role in the modified mechanical behaviour of the peened components. Due to several advantages shot peening has been in the focus of research persons for the purpose of increasing the properties of the materials. In the present paper, a review study has been done on the shot peening effects on different materials. This review will help the researchers and readers to better understand the several benefits and applications of shot peening. The present review of shot peening process is focused on the latest development and pushes the readers towards the on-going research in this classic process.

EBSD analysis showed an increase in the intensity of the Copper component at the surface as the number of rolling passes decreased, and a very strong Goss component in all samples analyzed. X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the strong copper component, but the Goss texture was much weaker when analyzed by X-ray diffraction, ultimately being nearly inexistent at mid thickness. The Brass component was very weak in EBSD analyses, but was found with higher intensity when texture was calculated using x-ray diffraction. The appearance of Goss component in surface grains can be explained by friction and shearing conditions in the roll-metal contact.},

  abstract = {An innovative crystal plasticity model was developed by incorporating the dislocation density-based hardening law, in which the grain-level hardening behavior is dependent on the evolution of the dislocation density in the cell walls and cell interiors and the evolution of the volume fraction of the cell walls. The large plastic deformations of OFHC copper single crystals and polycrystals were simulated by the two crystal plasticity models in conjunction with the dislocation density-based hardening law and the classic saturation-type phenomenological hardening law, respectively. A comprehensive comparison study on the 2 hardening laws was accordingly carried out in terms of the stress\textendash strain responses and texture evolutions. The simulation results of the two crystal plasticity models conjuncted with the different hardening laws have a good consistency, and both of them are generally in good agreement with the experimental data, which therefore validate the developed crystal plasticity model incorporated with the dislocation density-based hardening law. The Taylor-type mean-field model and Voronoi-type full-field model were, respectively, used as the homogenization schemes to calculate the macroscopic stress\textendash strain responses of the polycrystalline aggregate, and the two kinds of calculated results were compared and analyzed in detail. By using the Taylor-type mean-field crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM), the processes of single shot impact along the different impact angles were numerically simulated; the macroscopic plastic deformations, microscopic texture evolutions and dislocation density evolutions were resultantly investigated, which would conduce to the further study on the microscopic strengthening mechanisms of shot peening or surface mechanical attrition treatment, and the rise of the new ideas for relevant modeling.},

Accumulative skin pass rolling (ASPR) was employed to introduce heterogeneous structure in pure copper, which significantly improved yield strength and maintained high ductility. The experimental observations of the ASPR processed copper showed that surface grains possessed a much larger magnitude of misorientations and geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) than the centre grains. Crystal plasticity finite element modelling was utilised to provide an in-depth understanding of microstructure evolution during ASPR. It was found that the surface grains accommodated higher shear strain and had higher slip resistance than the centre grains. The multiple active slip systems in the surface grains induce the lattice rotations and then the formation of intragranular misorientations accompanied by a high density of GNDs, while the single active slip system in the centre grains can accommodate the applied material rotation without the lattice rotation.},

Gradient materials have been found to have superior mechanical properties due to the hetero-deformation induced (HDI) strengthening and strain hardening. However, the effect of the interaction between the GS layer and the CG layer on the mechanical properties of the gradient materials remains to be studied. In this paper, single-sided GS Cu and double-sided GS Cu plates were prepared by surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) on one side and both symmetrical sides respectively. It is found that GS samples have higher yield strength than CG samples, and the Cu samples with double-sided GS has an uniform elongation comparable to CG Cu. In addition, the global mutual constraint among different GS layers affect the mechanical behavior of gradient materials, which is revealed in the comparative study of double-sided and single-sided GS Cu. Specifically, the double-sided GS Cu exhibit higher yield strength and ductility than the single-sided GS Cu, because the former is better constrained. This study demonstrates that in addition to the local structural gradient, the symmetric constraint produce more effective HDI effect to enhance the mechanical properties. The global mutual constraints of GS layers played a positive role in producing superior mechanical properties.},

In the present work, three dimensional (3D) elastoplastic phase-field simulations are performed to study the kinetics of martensite reversion in stainless steels at different annealing temperatures. The input simulation data are acquired from different sources, such as CALPHAD, ab initio calculations, and experiments. The results show that the reversion occurs both at the lath boundaries as well as within the martensitic laths, which is in good agreement with the experimental observations. The reversion that occurs within the laths leads to splitting of a single martensite lath into two laths, separated by austenite. The results indicate that the reversed austenite retains a large extent of plasticity inherited from martensite.},

The yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and ductility (uniform elongation, UE) of the gradient-structured Cu are simultaneously increased with increasing strain rate, especially for the sample processed by longer SMAT-treating time, while the coarse-grained (CG) Cu showed no obvious strain rate effect on strength and ductility. In addition, the strain rate sensitivity (m) and hetero-deformation induced (HDI) stress of the gradient-structured samples also increased with increasing strain rate. The increase in strength is mainly attributed to the gradient-structured layers and HDI stress strengthening. On the other hand, the increase in ductility can be attributed to an increase in strain rate sensitivity (m) and the strain hardening induced by the accumulation of a large number of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDS) caused by a large stress gradient (HDI hardening).

The threshold temperature for recrystallization and the effect of annealing temperature on recrystallization were studied. The results show that the threshold temperature for recrystallization of the shot-peened DD3 samples is between 1 000\textdegree C and 1 050\textdegree C under the condition of annealing for 2 h, and the recrystallization depth increases with the rise of the annealing temperature. Below 1 150\textdegree C, the recrystallization depth increases slowly with the temperature climbing, while above 1 150\textdegree C, the recrystallization depth increases quickly with the rise of the temperature. The solution of the y phase is a critical factor of the recrystallization behavior of DD3 superalloy. In addition, the kinetics and microstructural evolution of recrystallization at 1 200\textdegree C were also studied. It is found that the recrystallization progresses rapidly at 1 200\textdegree C through the growth of fully developed recrystallized grains, and the recrystallization process on the shot-peened surface is similar to that of wrought materials, including nucleation of recrystallization, growth of new grains into the matrix, and growth of new grains by swallowing up each other.},

  abstract = {Gradient structured (GS) metals can simultaneously achieve high strength and high ductility, which is the pursuit of structural materials. Abundant studies have pointed out that significant kinematic hardening is key to their strength-ductility combination. Unfortunately, few constitutive models were established to simulate and analyze the characteristic kinematic hardening behavior of GS metals. Thus, a systematic and deep understanding of the relationship between graded microstructure and the resulting macroscopic response needs further effort. In this work, we develop a strain gradient plasticity model that considers plasticity heterogeneities from the grain to the sample scale. A back stress model, which accounts for the dependency of dislocation pileups on grain size, is established to describe the cyclic deformation properties of GS materials. The established model unifies the concepts of geometrically necessary dislocations accommodating plasticity heterogeneities, grain size-dependent back stress, and reversible dislocation motion during reverse loading into a strain gradient plasticity framework. A finite element implementation of the model quantitatively predicts the uniaxial tensile and tensile-compressive responses of a GS copper bar as well as of homogeneously grained reference samples. The simulation indicates that the enhanced kinematic hardening of GS copper results mainly from fine grains in the GS layer and contributes to the considerable ductility of the GS material. The strain gradient cyclic plasticity model enables future investigation of the cyclic/fatigue behavior of GS materials, which is vital for the engineering application.},
