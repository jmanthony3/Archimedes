## Annotations
#shot-peening and [[annealing]] induces surface #recrystallization to examine dependence of temperature on stress-rupture property. **Surface #recrystallization greatly *reduced* high-temperature [stress rupture](stress-rupture.md) life.** *Linear decrease in [stress rupture](stress-rupture.md) life with increase of #recrystallization-volume-fraction.* #void-coalescence fracture was mode of failure of recrystallized and bare specimens, but the recrystallized specimen failed early because of #crack-initiation, which have no bearing capacity. Evidenced by #grain-boundary cracks perpendicular to main stress axis: these [stress concentrations](stress-concentration.md) increase the actual stress in material matrix. #crack-initiation between the #recrystallization-layer and the matrix and #intergranular #crack-propagation toward matrix. Failure by *#intergranular cracking*, which is indicative of *[[brittle-fracture]]* occurring at the #triple-junction of grains with no grain deformation; however, can be #transgranular cracks i.e. *[[lesson-11-ductile-fracture]]* with elongation of grains [Damage and Fracture - Lesson 31: Creep].

## Abstract
A #single-crystal (SC) superalloy was shot peened and heat treated to induce surface recrystallization, and then the influence of surface recrystallization on the high-temperature stress rupture property and fracture behavior of the SC superalloy was investigated through high-temperature stress rupture tests. The results show that surface recrystallization greatly reduced the high-temperature stress rupture life of the SC superalloy, and the stress rupture life declined nearly linearly with the increase of the recrystallized fraction of the transverse section. At 1000Â°C/195MPa, the recrystallized specimens and the bare ones (without recrystallization) fractured in the same mode: microvoid coalescence fracture. The recrystallized layers cracked in the initial stage, so they nearly had no bearing capacity, which is the main cause for the remarkable decrease in the stress rupture life.
