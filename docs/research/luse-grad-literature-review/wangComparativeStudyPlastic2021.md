### Abstract
Innovative model based on #grain-hardening and evolution of #dislocation-density and volume fraction of cell walls. Validated by #single-crystal and polycrystal #OFHC copper by #dislocation-density hardening law and classic saturation phenomenological hardening law wrt to #stress-strain and #texture evolution. Taylor and Voronoi-type models for homogenization schemes. **Used #FEM for #single-impact at varying angles for numerical simulation.**

*[OFHC]: Oxygen Free Highly Conductive


### Introduction
Understanding heterogeneous #plastic-deformation mechanisms required to take advantage of metallic material capabilities from microstructure evolution to macroscopic performance that character in-service performance (#CPSPP). #Crystal-Plasticity-Theory can accurately describe microstructure behaviors.

## Abstract
An innovative crystal plasticity model was developed by incorporating the #dislocation-density-based hardening law, in which the grain-level hardening behavior is dependent on the evolution of the #dislocation-density in the cell walls and cell interiors and the evolution of the volume fraction of the cell walls. The large plastic deformations of #OFHC copper #single-crystals and polycrystals were simulated by the two crystal plasticity models in conjunction with the #dislocation-density-based hardening law and the classic saturation-type phenomenological hardening law, respectively. A comprehensive comparison study on the 2 hardening laws was accordingly carried out in terms of the stress–strain responses and #texture evolutions. The simulation results of the two crystal plasticity models conjuncted with the different hardening laws have a good consistency, and both of them are generally in good agreement with the experimental data, which therefore validate the developed crystal plasticity model incorporated with the #dislocation-density-based hardening law. The Taylor-type mean-field model and Voronoi-type full-field model were, respectively, used as the homogenization schemes to calculate the macroscopic stress–strain responses of the polycrystalline aggregate, and the two kinds of calculated results were compared and analyzed in detail. By using the Taylor-type mean-field crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM), the processes of single shot impact along the different impact angles were numerically simulated; the macroscopic #plastic-deformation, microscopic #texture evolutions and #dislocation-density evolutions were resultantly investigated, which would conduce to the further study on the microscopic strengthening mechanisms of #shot-peening or #SMAT (#SMAT), and the rise of the new ideas for relevant modeling.
