## Annotations
Reducing [[grain-size]] improves strength and ductility. [[Johnson-Cook]] model in computational simulation was used to predict [[plastic-deformation]], penetration, and fragmentation. Failure defined by [[Bao-Wierzbicki-criterion]], and adiabatic temperature increase by [[Taylor-Quinney-method]]. **Numerical results from computational, [[Johnson-Cook]] model predicts improved ballistic performance with decreasing [[grain-size]].** [[ultrafine-grain]] saw best performance and protection and most belated occurrence of [[microcrack]]. Performance of pure copper attributed to high ductility: microstructure homogenity. [[ultrafine-grain]] copper saw greatest strength from finest [[grain-size]]. Nanotwinned copper limited by deleterious effects of interface bonding during high-speed impact and penetration.
*Source includes [[Johnson-Cook]] model parameters and relies on [[von-Mises]] failure criterion.*

## Abstract
Numerical simulations were conducted to compare ballistic performance and penetration mechanism of copper (Cu) with four representative grain sizes. Ballistic limit velocities for coarse-grained (CG) copper (grain size ≈ 90 μm), regular copper (grain size ≈ 30 μm), fine-grained (FG) copper (grain size ≈ 890 nm), and ultrafine-grained (UG) copper (grain size ≈ 200 nm) were determined for the first time through the simulations. It was found that the copper with reduced grain size would offer higher strength and better ductility, and therefore renders improved ballistic performance then the CG and regular copper. High speed impact and penetration behavior of the FG and UG copper was also compared with the CG coppers strengthened by nanotwinned (NT) regions. The comparison results showed the impact and penetration resistance of UG copper is comparable to the CG copper strengthened by NT regions with the minimum twin spacing. Therefore, besides the NT regions-strengthened copper, the single phase copper with nanoscale grain size could also be a strong candidate material for better ballistic protection. A computational modeling and simulation framework was proposed for this study, in which Johnson-Cook (JC) constitutive material model is used to predict the plastic deformation of Cu and Ni; JC damage model is to capture the penetration and fragmentation behavior of Cu; Bao-Wierzbicki (B-W) failure criterion defines the material’s failure mechanisms; and temperature increase during this adiabatic penetration process is given by the Taylor-Quinney method.
