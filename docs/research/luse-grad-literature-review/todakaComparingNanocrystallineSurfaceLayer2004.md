## Annotations
Sharp boundaries just under the #nanocrystalline-layer, which is very hard, separate from bulk material. **Annealing shows slow #grain-growth without #recrystallization.** #nanocrystalline-volume larger in ABSP than USSP. Deformed structure region is thicker and the strain is smaller in ABSP than USSP. #shot-peening produces #nanocrystalline-volume with extreme hardness; #sharp-boundary; dissolution of existing [[cementite]]; and no annealing #recrystallization. Cast steel shot--$\varnothing 0.05 mm$ @ $190\frac{m}{s}$) and $\varnothing 0.3 mm$ @ $100\frac{m}{s}$--at steel of varying concentrations of #martensite, #pearlite, #spherodite, and #ferrite. Later annealed at 873 K for 3,600 s.

## Abstract
Surface #nanocrystallization in various steels by #shot-peening (both air blast (ABSP) and ultrasonic (USSP)) was investigated. In all the shot-peened specimens, the equiaxed nanocrystals with grain size of several 10 nm were observed at the surface regions. The depth of #nanocrystalline-layer (NC) was several Î¼m. The #nanocrystalline-layer have extremely high hardness and were separated from the deformed structure regions just under the #nanocrystalline-layer with #sharp-boundary. By annealing, the #nanocrystalline-layer show the substantially slow grain growth without recrystallization. These characteristics are similar to those observed in the specimens treated by ball milling, ball drop and particle impact deformation. Comparing ABSP and USSP at the similar peening condition, the produced volume of #nanocrystalline-layer region in ABSP is larger than that in USSP.
