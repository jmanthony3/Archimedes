## Annotations
- Material: Nickel
- Type: Experiment
- Notes: [[coarse-grain-zones]] in [[ultrafine-grain-matrix]] inhibits cracking by first observation of structural [[micro-shear-band]], which supports claim of dispersing [[shear-bands]] with heterostructure. [[triple-junction]] at grain interfaces delay [[crack-initiation]] and block [[crack-propagation]] by reducing local stress concentrations. Heterostructure experiment showed more accurate [[yield-strength]] and [[ultimate-tensile-strength]] than by [[rule-of-mixtures]]. [[strain-hardening]] is retarded by smaller grains.

## Abstract
Systematic study was conducted on the microstructures and mechanical properties of nickel samples with two distinct types of heterostructures. The ﬁrst is featured with coarse-grained lamellae embedded in a matrix consisting of a very high density of dislocation structures. The second is featured with coarse-grained zones embedded in the ultraﬁne-grained matrix. The second type of heterostructures exhibits better strength and ductility, although it has a smaller average grain size than the ﬁrst type. The zone boundaries in the second type of heterostructures are less prone to cracking than those in the ﬁrst type. Intersecting micro-shearbands formed net-like patterns in the second type of heterostructures during tensile deformation. This is the ﬁrst ever observation of structural micro-shear-bands in a heterostructured material. It supports the claim that heterostructure promotes the formation of dispersive shear bands. In contrast, a macroscopic shear band formed and caused early failure of the sample with the ﬁrst type of heterostructures. Our results indicate that well-developed ultraﬁne/nano grained matrix in heterostructured materials are necessary for preventing crack formation and shear band localization. This should be considered as a key factor for optimizing the mechanical properties of heterostructured materials.
