this includes consideration of how different operating conditions can affect the magnitude of the benefit.\r\nThe second part of the review details the life assessment approaches which have been developed to date incorporating these effects and seeks to identify the areas in which further development is still required before the models can be applied in structural integrity assessments.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-soadyLifeAssessmentMethodologies2013-annotations, {counter:subs}]\r\n=== Annotations\r\nFatigue life affected by surface roughness (texture) and #residual-stress profiles.\r\n_"Complete #residual-stress distribution rarely determined by experiment."_\r\nFEM limited by constitutive material models and physical testing, which greatly affect the #residual-stress distribution.\r\nLittle is known of strain-hardening affects.\r\n_"[lots] of consistency in results between methods has raised questions as to which method is most appropriate."_\r\nA validated model needs to be accepted by scientific community.\r\nShot-peening is beneficial for HCF, despite surface roughness insignificantly accelerating crack initiation, by the strain-hardening inhibiting crack propagation; however considered less beneficial in LCF because of high-amplitude, applied stresses relaxing the #residual-stress, which allows the dislocations to recover.\r\nUnderstanding this interplay, along with temperature dependence, is crucial to understand crack growth and how #residual-stress might relax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-chenLiteratureReviewNumerical2019, {counter:secs}, {counter:subs}, {counter:figs}]\r\n== Literature review of numerical simulation and optimisation of the shot peening process\r\n:subs: 0\r\n:figs: 0\r\ncite:[chenLiteratureReviewNumerical2019]\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-chenLiteratureReviewNumerical2019-abstract, {counter:subs}]\r\n=== Abstract\r\nThis work provides a comprehensive review of numerical simulation and optimisation of the shot-peening found in the existing literature over the past 10 years.\r\nThe review found that the developed numerical models coupling finite elements with discrete elements became increasingly mature and showed their advantages in incorporating flow behaviour and randomness of shots.\r\nHigh emphasis must be placed on the constitutive equations of target material where its strain-rate sensitivity, cyclic behaviour and Bauschinger Effect are recommended to be incorporated in the numerical material model simultaneously since considering one of them in isolation may lead to unreliable distribution of #residual-stresses.\r\nFurthermore, material hardening is a critical benefit of shot-peening; however, it has not received its deserved attention from the existing investigations, neither in simulation nor in optimisation.\r\nThe study found that intensity and coverage are two critical control parameters recommended to be constraints for optimisation of shot-peening.\r\nFinally, this work also found that developed heuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithms have recently showed their advantages for searching optimal combinations of peening parameters.\r\nIt is plausible that in the near future, the synergy of combining these algorithms with approximation models can be expected to gain more attention by researchers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-chenLiteratureReviewNumerical2019-annotations, {counter:subs}]\r\n=== Annotations\r\nSimulations recently done well to include randomness of shot and not exclude consideration for strain-rate sensitivity, cyclic behaviors (fatigue), and the Bauschinger Effect;

the macroscopic plastic deformations, microscopic texture evolutions and dislocation density evolutions were resultantly investigated, which would conduce to the further study on the microscopic strengthening mechanisms of shot peening or surface mechanical attrition treatment, and the rise of the new ideas for relevant modeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-wangComparativeStudyPlastic2021-annotations, {counter:subs}]\r\n=== Annotations\r\n==== Abstract\r\nInnovative model based on grain-hardening and evolution of dislocation density and volume fraction of cell walls.\r\nValidated by #single-crystal and polycrystal OFHC copper by dislocation density hardening law and classic saturation phenomenological hardening law with respect to stress-strain and texture evolution.\r\nTaylor and Voronoi-type models for homogenization schemes.\r\n*Used FEM for single impact at varying angles for numerical simulation.*\r\n\r\n==== Introduction\r\nUnderstanding heterogeneous plastic deformation mechanisms required to take advantage of metallic material capabilities from microstructure evolution to macroscopic performance that character in-service performance (CPSPP).\r\nCrystal Plasticity Theory can accurately describe microstructure behaviors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[appendix#sec-appendix-hassani]\r\n== Al-Hassani\r\n[#fig-slip_line_flow_fields, caption="Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}.
