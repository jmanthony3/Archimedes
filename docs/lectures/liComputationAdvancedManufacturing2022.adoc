Dr. Horstemeyer met Dr. Li at Mississippi State and is one of the leading experts in TEM microscopy of steel and magnesium.
He is apparently one of the quickest proposal writers that Dr. Horstemeyer he has ever seen.

Dr. Li has worked primarily on magnesium alloys, but has also explored steels.

https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/DOE_CMS2011_FINAL_Full.pdf[The DOE makes several claims and reasons to make materials lighter.]
Steel, for example, is very dense compared to magnesium and aluminum.
Lowering the density lowers the mass.
For example, at Mississippi State, Dr. Horstemeyer and Li made a 22 lb engine cradle for the 2006 Chevy Corvette.
Today, vehicles are much heavier than they were because of increasingly more rigorous regulations on vehicle safety.
From 1975-2007, there has been a dramatic increase in Medium and High Strength Steels and Aluminum.

.Development of 3G Advanced High Strength Steels
In a simple "banana curve" for elongation percentage to tensile strength, first generation steels are more dramatically defined covering the lower left-hand side and second generation are in the upper right-hand corner.
Third generation steels must be somewhere in the middle.
Car manufacturers do not like to raise temperatures to process metals because costs increase.

Carbon can be cheaply added to steels, but too much makes product too brittle or inability to weld.
Silicon and magnanese can quickly oxidize the steel.

.Continuous Galvaninizing Line for Steels
These galvanizing lines are over a mile long.
The wrought steel is mildly oxized before being drawn through the line to fire it, encoat with zinc, and firing again to cure before being rolled into spools.

.Complex Interfacial Reactions During Galvanizing
Most interest reactions occur at the interface boundary.
TEM images show some aluminum present.
Aluminum is included in the molten zinc bath to enhance galvanizability.
This forms an inhibition layer which is important for galvanized products.
Oxides on a surface or substrate because this likely disturbs how evenly and uniformly the zinc layer forms on the steel surfaces.

.Composition of DP Samples Between Steel Substrate and Zinc Layers
Experimental studies can observe these layers via TEM microscopy.
FIB processing can create a 1 nm wafer in the surface of the sample.
This small sample gets welded to a titanium needle via an ion beam.
This sample is observed in the TEM.
The inhibition layer here is ~100 nm.
At this scale, an oxidation layer can be seen between the steel substrate and the inhibition layer and form on the steel substrate sufrace (about 20 nm thick).
Apparently, manganese has little effect on the galvanizing process which is good news for coating.

Ideally, modeling research explores this galvanizing process.
This inhibition layer is comprised of oxides, manganese, and solid zinc.

.Multiscale Modeling Scheme
The key point of this research was to develop Atomistic simulation and potentials by DFT.
*This is ICME!*
MEAM potentials made by Fe-Mn-Si-C, low alloy, BCC steel substrate; Fe2Al5 or Fe3Al8 inhibition layer; 
Using equations from Mike Baskes for MEAM formulation, an embedding function of stem:[F_{i}(\bar{\rho_{i}}) = \begin{cases}A_{i}E_{i}^{0}\bar{\rho_{i}}\ln(\bar{\rho_{i}}), & \bar{\rho_{i}} < 0 \\\ -A_{i}E_{i}^{0}\bar{\rho_{i}}, & \bar{\rho_{i}} > 0\end{cases}] which differs from our ICME class!
This all had to begin with single-element definitions for each alloying element before moving onto the whole system.
Characterizing silicon-oxides prove time-consuming which must be done because not all published data is reliable.
For example, the potential needed to be defined for Fe5Al8 instead of previously published Fe2Al5.
Convex-Hull Criterion from thermodynamics verifies the accuracy of the interatomic potentials for developed phases above the line.

.Behavior of Fe-Al MEAM
Developed model well fits experimental data.
Alloys satisfy the Convex-Hull Criterion.

Same for Fe-Zn.
Same for Si-O except for elastic constants working to minimize errors.
Same for Fe-Mn.

Interface behavior has to repeated for each layer of atoms peeled off.
Some crystals do not bond at the interface because the grains actually repel each other.

ICME is well-suited to conquer complex problems which prove too expensive to run physical experiments.

== Questions
:subs: 0
:figs: 0

Why oxidize before coating?
Because oxygen is everywhere, so not why introduce it to saturate the environment.
This later postpones oxidation because the oxidation layer repels the oxygen.

How long did it take to develop the silicon-oxide?
This took a little over 2 years using the MEAM optimization tool from Ms. State.
AI may make this faster.
The limitations are on the manual parameter search and satisfying the Convex-Hull Criterion for stability.
Numerical iterations are necessary which is only a part of his dissertation.
This is to solve and engineering problem with the underlying science to produce an engineering solution.

What is the application of this work?
High-fidelity interatomic potentials can be applied to any problem.
However, the leading financial drive in USA is automobile.

Were the potentials from literature or did you develop your own?
One of Dr. Horstemeyer's former students already developed some data, but some was recalculated for validation.

If 3G steels is to fit the cost-performance hole in industry?
Hopefully, the developed interatomic potentials allows for more unique and creative "materials" recipes to manufacture new engineering materials.

If silicon is the most difficult to simulate, how do calculate a ternary system with say oxygen?
Develop the single-element parameters, then move to binaries which satisfy the Convex-Hull Criterion; therefore, the ternary system will work itself out as the single and binary systems are more accurately defined.

== Discussion

.Carbon Nanofibers
Dr. Atwater introduces some of the research topics with ball milling and naocrystallization with as catalysts for carbon nanofibers at temperatures and catalysts amount lower than to produce nanotubes.
This process could adjust the density and strength for carbon nanofibers.
These fibers are randomly oriented and not woven together: when mechanically tested, there is some elastic recovery (naturally).

.Micro-Porous Metals
We have a new SEM coming to analyze these sorts of materials; we could not get a TEM with FIB, but that was too expensive.
Our program is far too young to afford this.
Mark Chobb is a co-inventor of the technique to serialize SEM cross-sectional images.
Nano-porous metals can be produced without chemical etching with oxidation reduction.
The produced wafers can be stacked together and reduced to form a component.

.Metal Spheres
Planetary mill produces 1mm diameter balls.
Some of the pucks compress from lower sintering temperatures and some balls retain some of their porosity.
These could be encoated aluminum or zinc, but the machines have exploded.

Are there intermetallic phases between the aluminum/tin and copper when ball milled?
Yes, but we have yet to identify what those phases are.

Julian is trying to planetary mill with minimization how much powder is needed to deliver greater porosities.
He is trying to increase porosity without producing sphere that can be later turned into foams.
Adam has attempted to replicate this with magnesium, but the physics are very different because of oxidation behaviors.
Ideally, this would minimize corrosion effects for bio-compatible components.
Adding sulfur makes magnesium more ductile...maybe?
Their melting temperature are so different, this makes sintering difficult; therefore, metal alloying may work.
The same goes for manganese and sulfur.

Is there a banana plot for magnesium like there was for steels?
No. 20yrs of worldwide research and is still a mystery.

.Recrystallization does not usually occur at room temperatures, but here enough compression produced multiple grains from a single crystal specimen. The curve looks like a tensile curve for polycrystal materials.

.SMAT Literature
Currently, many random impacts occur for some time for some average impact energy without a well-known, scientific problem statement needs to be controlled for single impact behaviors.
A paper did SMAT for a short time and improved mechanical performance without much loss to ductility.
Can we control this process?
We are looking at Linear SMAT for a known time domain to establish some refined microstructure with known impact energies.
This could be applied to plastic deformation of magnesium to produce ultrafine grains.
Some methods to produce ultrafine grains is to friction stir the surface.
Another method is to laser shock peen to improve mechanical performance for metals not magnesium: laser shock peening performed no different or worse than not peened.

Is any effort on nanocrystallizing magnesium a waste of time?
No.
During these processing methods, something that people do not consider is production of microcracks in the material which magnesium has a strong affinity to produce microcracks during processing.
*Avoid microcracking during processing!*
Aluminum is easy to heat treat, but magnesium is not: why?
This requires work with DFT at electron scale.
