## Course Introduction
We will be looking at 3 underlying principles throughout this course:
1. #equilibrium-equations: all forces balanced
2. Mechanical Behavior ( #constitutive-equations ): use #stress-strain and force relationships that satisfy certain materials
3. Geometry of Deformation ( #compatibility-equations ): information throughout the body must fit together with other portions of the body

!!! attention Final Exam
    Final exam for graduate students is **open notes**.

Dr. Lugo will be assigning the Final Project based on Teams.
Design of Final Project should be validated with experiment.

!!! example Problem Set: 4-2
    **Problem 1**: A shaft that is part of a machine is shown.
    Compute #factor-of-safety, based upon the [distortion energy theory](engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/distortion-energy-theory-von-mises.md), for stress elements at $A$ and $B$ of the member.
    This bar is made of AISI 1006 cold-drawn steel and is loaded by $F = 0.75 kN$, $P = 4.0 kN$, and $T = 25 N-m$.

    | Adapted from handout. |

    Equilibrium of the shaft can be found by #compatibility-equations in a cross-section of the shaft.
    By this, $M_{y} = F*(100~mm) = 0.075 kN-m$.
    The stress components at point *A*: $\sigma = \frac{P}{A} = 362.1659149468907 MPa$, no bending effect from $F$, $\tau_{F} = \frac{4}{3}\frac{V}{A} = 90.54147873672268 MPa$, $\tau_{T} = \frac{Tr}{J} = 8488.263631567752 MPa$.
    The stress state at $A$: $\sigma = \begin{bmatrix}22.64 & 32.07 \\ 32.07 & 0\end{bmatrix}~MPa$.
    Therefore, $\sigma_{eq} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{x}^{2} + \sigma_{x}^{2}) + 3\tau_{xy}^{2}} = 59.98353357380674 MPa$ which yields $n = 280$.

    For point $B$: $\sigma = \frac{P}{A} = 22.64~MPa$, $\sigma_{F} = \frac{Mc}{I_{G}} = 0.00040240657216321195 MPa$, %\tau = 37.73 MPa$.
    $\sigma_{x} = 248.99 MPa$, $\tau_{xy} = 37.73 MPa$, and $\sigma_{eq} = 257.42 MPa$, and $n = 1.0877165721389168$.

    We ignore shear forces in plane to determine the load plane angle.

    | The maximum bending stresses and shear stresses occur at the outside surface. |

    We find the normal and shear forces with $I = \frac{\pi}{64}d^{4}$ and $J = \frac{\pi}{32}d^{4}$ by **[Maximum Shear Stress Theory](engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/maximum-shear-stress-theory-tresca.md)**, $\tau_{max} = \frac{\sigma_{x} + \sigma_{y}}{2} \pm \sqrt{(\frac{\sigma_{x} - \sigma_{y}}{2})^{2} + \tau_{xy}^{2}}$:

    $$\begin{split}
    \sigma &= \frac{M(\frac{d}{2})}{I} \\
    \tau &= \frac{T(\frac{d}{2})}{J} \\
    \tau_{max} &= \frac{16}{\pi d^{3}}\sqrt{M^{2} + T^{2}} \\
    \implies n = \frac{\sigma_{yp}}{2\tau_{max}} &:= d = 20.4~mm
    \end{split}$$

    **Problem 3**: The beam shown carries steady loads $P$ and $F$ equal to $2500 lb$ and $5000 lb$, respectively.
    Evaluate the design factor that would result if the beam were made from a gray cast iron ASTM No. 25 ($\sigma_{UT} = 26 ksi$ and $\sigma_{UC} = 97 ksi$).
    Consider a thickness of $t = 0.75 in$.

    The selection of material greatly matters when stress concentrations are involved.
    In this case, special notice must be given to these stress concentrations because the requested material is generally *brittle*.

*Lecture: March 24, 2022*

!!! example Problem Set: 5-2
    **Problem 1**: A composite beam is constructed from a wood beam and a steel reinforcing plate.
    The wood and steel are securely fastened to act as a single beam.
    The beam is subjected to a positive bending moment, $M = 6.8 kN-m$.
    Calculate the largest tensile and compressive stresses in the wood (Material 1) and the maximum and minimum tensile stresses in the steel (Material 2) if $E_{1} = 10 GPa$ and $E_{2} = 200 GPa$.

    **Solution**

    Determine the location of the N.A.

    $$\begin{split}
    E_{1}\int_{1}ydA + E_{2}\int_{2}ydA &= 0 \\
    E_{1}A_{1}d_{1} - E_{2}A_{2}d_{2} &= 0 \\
    A_{1} &= 15000~mm^{2} \quad A_{2} = 1200~mm^{2}
    \end{split}$$

    Solving $10(15000)(162â€…âˆ’â€…\bar{y}â€…âˆ’â€…75)â€…âˆ’â€…200(1200)(\bar{y}â€…âˆ’â€…6)â€„=â€„0$ for $\bar{y}$ yields $\bar{y}â€„=â€„37.15Â mm$.
    The moments of inertia with respect to N.A:

    $$\begin{split}
    I_{1} &= \frac{1}{12}(100)(150)^{3} + 1500(49.85)^{2} = 65.4e6~mm^{4} \\
    I_{2} &= \frac{1}{12}(100)(12)^{3} + 1200(31.15)^{2} = 1.178e6~mm^{4}
    \end{split}$$

    The maximum stresses are: $\sigma_{x1} = \frac{MyE_{1}}{E_{1}I_{1} + E_{2}I_{2}} = \frac{(16.8e6~kN-m)(162 - \bar{y})}{10(65.4e6) + 200(1.178e6)} = -6.65~MPa$.
    $\sigma_{x1c} = \frac{(6.8e6)(25.15)(10)}{E_{1}I_{1} + E_{2}I_{2}} = 1.92~MPa$ at the contact surface.
    $\sigma_{x2} = \frac{(6.8e6)(37.15)(200)}{E_{1}I_{1} + E_{2}I_{2}} = 56.78~MPa$.

    **Problem 3**

    The cross-section of a composite beam made of aluminum and steel is shown in the figure.
    The moduli of elasticity are $E_{a} = 75 GPa$ and $E_{s} = 200 GPa$.
    Under the action of a bending moment that produces a maximum stress of $50 MPa$ in the aluminum, what is the maximum stresses in the steel?

    **Problem 1**: The curved portion of the bar shown has an inner radius of $20 mm$.

    $$\begin{split}
    P &= 3~kN \\
    \implies M &= P(60 + 32.5)~mm = 277.5~kN-mm
    \end{split}$$

    By [Winklerâ€™s Method](engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/curved-beam-formula-winklers-theory.md):

    $$\begin{split}
    R &= \frac{h}{\ln(\frac{r_{o}}{{r_{i}}})} = \frac{25~mm}{\ln(\frac{45}{20})} = 30.83~mm \\
    \sigma_{\theta} &= \frac{M(R - r)}{Aer} \\
    e &= \bar{r} - R = (32.5 - 30.83)~mm = 1.67~mm \\
    r &= r_{i} = 20~mm \\
    A &= (25~mm)^{2} = 625~mm^{2} \\
    \implies \sigma_{\theta} &= \frac{(277.5~kN-mm)(30.83-20)~mm}{(625~mm^{2})(1.67~mm)(20~mm)} = 143.96766467065865 kPa

    $e = \bar{r} - R = 4.321â€…âˆ’â€…4.058â€„=â€„0.263Â in$.
    For point $A$, $r = 3Â in$ and $\sigma_{\theta} = \frac{M(R - r)}{Aer} = \frac{8000~lb-in(4.058 - 3)~in}{3.5~in^{2}(0.263~in)(3~in)} = 3.06~ksi$.
