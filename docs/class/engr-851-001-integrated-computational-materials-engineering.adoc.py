Studying the molecular dynamics requires knowledge of the interatomic potential energy. This process can take an entire year; therefore, you could study a material for whom its properties are known to lay down the process before studying a new material.\r\n====\r\n\r\n[WARNING]\r\n.Semester Project\r\n====\r\nDo not think too ambitious nor impossible.\r\n====\r\n\r\n.Course Objectives\r\nStudents will learn to bridge length scales to process and understand computational tools to solve problems at these scales.\r\nThis means to bring information up from electrons, atoms, microns, hundreds of microns, mesoscale, and macroscale.\r\nThe material length scale observed varies its properties.\r\nMacroscale length scale is affected by all length scales below it.\r\n\r\nSome properties may be very important at a certain length scale but may disappear altogether at higher length scales.\r\nThe idea, then, is to integrated all this information from lower to higher length scales: e.g. plasticity, damage, or deformation.\r\nThe case studies given provide real world examples of the ICME process.\r\n\r\n.Course Schedule\r\nDr. Cho will teach us introductory Linux commands.\r\nWe may learn to apply the machine learning package for molecular dynamics.\r\n\r\n[qanda, role=center]\r\nWhat softwares do we need?:: -- Noel A.\r\nDr. Cho will install many softwares on our HPC cluster that we, students, may use them. Quantum Espresso for DFT (electronic principles), LAMMPS for molecular dynamics, dislocation dynamics by MDDP, crystal plasticity with Abaqus and material model codes and ISV model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[#sec-multiscale_modeling, {counter:secs}, {counter:subs}, {counter:figs}]\r\n== Multiscale Modeling\r\n:subs: 0\r\n:figs: 0\r\nMuch of this class material has been developed by Dr. Horstemeyer himself.\r\n\r\nICME:: Integrated Computational Materials Engineering\r\n\r\n.Six Advantages of Employing ICME in Design\r\n. Simulation-based design affords virtual optimization instead of many, costly, physical design iterations by trial-and-error.\r\n. ICME can reduce product costs through innovation in material, product, and process designs.\r\n. ICME can reduce number of costly, large-scale systems experiments.\r\n. ICME can increase product quality and performance by providing more accurate predictions of response to design loads.\r\n. ICME can help develop new materials.\r\n. ICME can help medical practice in making diagnostic and prognostic evaluations related to the human body.\r\n\r\n.Eight Guidelines for ICME Bridging\r\n\r\n[#fig-icme_diagram, caption="Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. ", reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}", role=center]\r\n.This is the ICME diagram.

", reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}"]\r\n\r\nThe ISV codes are based in physics.\r\nAt the electronic (angstrom) level, we can find the elastic moduli with DFT calculations: i.e. with Quantum Espresso.\r\nAtomistics can find the interatomic energy potentials: i.e. found with MEAM by LAMMPS.\r\nMolecular dynamics can find mobility--i.e. dislocation mobility--which varies for each material to solve dislocation dynamics by MDDP codes.\r\nMicroscopic motion for dislocation motions and their interactions which work-hardens the material by pinning dislocations: solved by hardening rules and parameters in ISV.\r\nThis bridges up to crystal plasticity which requires these hardening parameters within ISV codes to capture grain orientation, slip system interactions, texture, etcetera of polycrystalline materials to build stress-strain behavior curves.\r\nParticle-void interactions can be implemented in ISV-damage model with elastic moduli and interfacial energies found at lower length-scales.\r\n\r\nIf problem is about deformation and damage, then you need ISV model.\r\nHomeworks will require ISV.\r\nOtherwise, ISV is not needed.\r\n\r\nFinally, continuum calculations with ISV codes in softwares--such as Abaqus--can run the appropriate simulations according to the prescribed boundary conditions.\r\n\r\n. Downscaling and upscaling: only use the minimum required degree(s) of freedom necessary for the type of problem considered.\r\n. Downscaling and upscaling: energy consistency between the scales.\r\n. Downscaling and upsaling: verify the numerical model\'s implementation before starting calculations.\r\n. Downscaling: start with downscaling before upscaling to help make clear the final goal, requirements, and constraints at the highest length scales.\r\n. Downscaling: find the pertinent variable and associated equation(s) to be the repository of the structure-property relationship from sub-scale information.\r\n. Upscaling: find the pertinent "effect" for the next higher scale by applying ANOVA methods.\r\n. Upscaling: validate the "effect" by an experiment before using it in the next higher length-scale.\r\n. Upscaling: quantify the uncertainty (error) bands (upper and lower values) of the particular "effect" before using it in the next higher length-scale, and then use those limits to help determine the "effects" at the next higher length-scale.\r\n\r\n.Multiscale Experiments\r\n\r\n[#fig-multiscale_experiment_cycle, caption="Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}.

Temperature or stress in a material might be obsverved under deformation, but certain things within material should also be considered: such as void damage.\r\n\r\nDr. Horstemeyer was responsible to formulate the damage kinetics in this model; wherein, fracture occurs at an upper limit of a rapidly increasing volume fraction.\r\nThe ISV variable of interest could be damage, volume fraction of free volume, etcetera.\r\n\r\n.Plasticity: Dislocation nucleation, propagation, and interaction have several length scales.\r\n* Stress is inversely propoertional to Burger\'s vector (Frank, Nabarro), stem:[\\sigma \\propto \\frac{1}{\\vec{b}}]\r\n* Diffusion rate, stem:[e \\propto \\frac{1}{d^{2}}]\r\n* Hall-Petch Effect, stem:[\\sigma = \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{d}}]\r\n* Dislocation density (Ashby), stem:[r \\dots]\r\n* Dislocation bowing (Frank-Read Source), stem:[T = \\frac{G\\vec{b}}{L - 2r}]\r\n* Geometrically necessary boundary spacing decreases with applied strain\r\n* Strain gradients reflect length scales in plasticity\r\n* Yield...\r\n\r\n[#fig-length_scale_determines_stress_strain_behavior, caption="Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}.
