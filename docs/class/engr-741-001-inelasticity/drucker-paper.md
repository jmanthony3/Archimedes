# Drucker Paper
We use the yield function to associate the direction of plastic flow instead of using the plastic potential directly.

Drucker's Postulate
: Work-hardening means that for all such added sets of stresses, the material will remain in equilibrium and further that
1. positive work is done by the *external agency* during the application of the added set of stresses and
2. the net work performed by the *external agency* over the cycle of application and removal is positive if plastic deformation has occurred in the cycle.
The net work is zero if and only if elastic changes in strain alone are produced.
