# Recrystallization
Earlier ISV models used only the initial and final grain sizes and these were treated as fixed values for other empirical calculations.
Dr. Cho's recrystallization paper sought to unify static (under elevated temperature) and dynamic (during deformation) recrystallization but also couple grain size evolution during deformation.
Driving force for grain growth is to minimize free energy/surface tension, and this is mediated by the grains growing and reducing overall grain boundary area.
==Driving force of recrystallization is very different for grain growth.==
Ultimately, recrystallization reduces the plastic strain energy imbued from dislocations.
Grains recrystallize around and absorb defects to re-bond atoms together especially during annealing.
Dislocations will come together to form low-angle sub-grain boundaries as dislocation walls within grains which reduces the dislocation density in the sub-grains to reduce material strength.
If at lower temperature and high enough strain rate, grain size will reduce because the grains are recrystallizing into sub-grains.
If temperature is high enough, the grains may recrystallize and grow at the same time to minimize the grain boundary area and absorb dislocations.
Dr. Cho did not use the Avrami equation because that is an analytical solution to match experimental data and is not actually a rate form of kinetics.
The large bump in the first step of tube forming came from the rollers being too close together (according to the vice president making a comment about complaining to replace that particular roller so often).
