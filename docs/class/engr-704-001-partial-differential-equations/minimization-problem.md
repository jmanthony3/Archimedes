# Minimization Problem

The function $u$ is the unique solution to the differential equation iff $u$ is the unique function that minimizes the following integral:
$$\begin{equation}
I(\mathcal{v}) = \int_{0}^{1}\big[p(x)(\mathcal{v}'(x))^{2} - 2f(x)\mathcal{v}(x)\big]dx
\end{equation}$$
which is formed by substituting $\mathcal{v}$ for $u$: $\int_{0}^{1} pu'\mathcal{v}'dx = \int_{0}^{1}f\mathcal{v}dx$ wherein the [basis function](basis-function.md) is $\mathcal{v}$.
The function is $C^{n}$.
