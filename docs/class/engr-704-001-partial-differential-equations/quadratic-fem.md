# Quadratic FEM (k = 2)

On each sub-interval, the #basis-function is a quadratic polynomial, which requires to determine three coefficients: three points must be set on each sub-interval. The two endpoints are nodal points, and the middle point is an extra point. Higher #basis-function are more precise but require more calculations.
