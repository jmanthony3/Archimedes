# Quadratic FEM (k = 2)

On each sub-interval, the [basis function](basis-function.md) is a quadratic polynomial, which requires to determine three coefficients: three points must be set on each sub-interval.
The two endpoints are nodal points, and the middle point is an extra point.
Higher [basis function](basis-function.md) are more precise but require more calculations.
