# Physical Classifications

## #equilibrium
A solution of given #PDE is desired in a closed domain that is subject to prescribed set of boundary conditions. Typically is a #BVP. E.g. #steady-state temperature distributions, incompressible inviscid flows, #residual-stress-distribution in solids, atomic diffusions, etcetera.

!!! example Laplace Equation
    $\nabla^{2}\phi = \Delta\phi = \frac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial x^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial y^{2}} = 0$, where $\tau$ is the boundary and $\Omega$ is the domain.

## #eigenvalue
Extension of equilibrium problems. The solution exists only from some discrete value of a parameter, $\lambda_{i}$. E.g. buckling and stability of structures, resonance in electric circuits, and natural frequencies in vibration, etcetera.

## #marching
Sometimes called "propagation," these are #transient problems.
