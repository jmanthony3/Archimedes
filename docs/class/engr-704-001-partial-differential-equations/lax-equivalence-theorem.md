# Lax Equivalence Theorem

Given a [well-posed](well-posed-problem.md) #IVP and #FDM to it that satisfies the [consistency](consistency.md) condition, [stability](stability.md) is the **necessary and sufficient condition for convergence**.

**Most of the time, we assume that the *Lax Equivalence Theorem* is satisfied even though it has never been proved for non-linear equations.**
