# Constitutive Behavior Classification of Stress-Strain Response in Materials

**Elastic**

!!! question Why do we need the elastic behavior? <cite> Dr. Cho
    The main laws of physics and equations are not always well represented in codes.
    Therefore, encoded equations need some correction parameter.
    For example, Dr. Cho had to quantify the viscosity of Earthâ€™s mantle during the flood.
