2. Brittle vs. Ductile Fracture
- Ductile - extensive plastic deformation and energy absorption (toughness) before fracture
- Brittle materials - little plastic deformation and low energy absorption before fracture
- The difference between these: "It depends."
  - _Always ask what it means to the person speaking._
  - Definitions can mean different things to different people. _Dr. H's story of stress for materials scientist, physicist, and solid mechanics guy._

3. Brittle vs. Ductile Fracture
- Things usually become more brittle the colder they are (A36 is an exception: common structural steel).

4. Ductile Fracture (Dislocation Mediated)
- Necking requires void nucleation or coalescence to occur; therefore, necking does not always occur before failure.
- Dr. H's continuum model can capture all this

5. Ductile Fracture
- Voids and pores are synonymous in materials science, but "pores" are preferred because "void" usually refers to astronomical events.
- Cup-Cone interaction forces pore growth in the dead center, and a shear band at $45^{\circ}$ in uni-axial loading. 
  - Stress state divided by von Mises.
  - Tensile pressure applies here, which applies uni-axially in this particular scenario.

6. Ductile Fracture 
- Like in medicine, some definitions are labelled differently depending on the scenario and observer.
- Today, we are bridging the materials science and physics, because the constitutive physics are the same.

## Why is a temperature increase showing failure strain in opposite directions for ductile metals?
- Suggested working hypothesis:
  - Nucleation decreases in elevated temperatures and coalescence increases
  - Inverse for lower temperatures
- Failure is not "ductile-brittle" dominated, but nucleation-coalescence.
  - Left coalesced faster at higher temperature.
  - Right nucleated faster at lower temperatures.
  - Strain-rate and temperature are inversely related and inverse effects.

**T/F when strain-rate increases in ductile failure, does nucleation or coalescence dominate?*- _It depends._

  - If **coalescence*- increases with increased temperature, then it inversely decreases if strain-rate increases; therefore, greater elongation at failure.
  - **Nucleation*- increases at lower temperatures, but if strain-rate also decreases, then nucleation will decrease.

>"If you understand this paradigm, you have solved the general behavior of all materials." <cite> MH

>"There is no material that violates this _law_: the inverse relation of temperature and strain-rate." <cite> MH (from DK's question if this held for _odd_ materials: A36 steel becoming harder at elevated temperatures)

- Q: >"Does void growth not affect damage?" <cite> JD
- A: It is involved, but not dominating.

- Q: If the infinite radius notch simplifies to uniaxial loading, where the gradient of tri-axiality > 0.66, is this why the void nucleates at the center and not the edges?
- A: YES!
