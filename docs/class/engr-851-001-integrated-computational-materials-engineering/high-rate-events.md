# High-Rate Events

- Covering high-rate phenomenon.
- Shockwave, stress wave, and pressure wave are synonymous, but fluids people will reject the work, because shockwave relates to speed of sound in a medium.
- Pressure wave is the long-diagonal (first invariant) of the stress tensor.
- In previous classes, we say that stress is seen throughout the whole body, but now we say that is varies through the part, because of the high-rate nature.

- $\sigma_{xx} = \sigma_{zz} = 0$. This is uniaxial.
- 3 waves in Hoppy Bar
  - Incident: initial contact to hockey puck specimen.
  - Transmitted: through specimen to other side of Hoppy Bar.
  - Reflected: reflection of wave back up Hoppy Bar from specimen.
- The reflected wave is opposite of the sense of the incident wave upon a free surface.
  - Not as simple as the difference of the front and back of a wave.
  - The reflected wave is very sensitive to the time domain.
  - Also extremely sensitive to material geometry.
- _Easy journal paper for high-rate data for your material._
- Can also generate stress-strain curve from video recording, because you know the frame rate.
- Wave speed:
  - $\omega_{s} = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}$
  - The wave moves through the material faster than it can strain.
    - When an ocean
  - The time domain affects the rate of energy domains through the material.
  - **Is the strain of the material its response to keep conservation of momentum?** _It depends. The time step is very significant. Any dislocation is the material dissipating energy. So modeling assumes piecewise-linear between time points and thermodynamic equilibrium._
- Hoppy Bar of magnesium:
  - Slip plane at $45^{\circ}$. Twin plane?
  - There is no barreling, because the surfaces attempt to remain friction free.
  - Force cannot be found, because the pressure wave has already moved through the material, and we can only see the strain with our eyes.
- MFH became a believer in simulation experiments by validating with physical experiments of high-rate explosions for submarine design in 1990.

- If the reflected wave is opposite in sense to the incident wave from a free surface.
  - If compression, tension would try to open a void.
  - What if we did two voids within a material?
  - Shear occurred in single void, but not for two.
  - Therefore, strain rate dependent. 
- Hydrodynamics:= strength of material does not matter, because the strain rate is so high.
- The strain rate threshold is $10^{5}/s$ when state of material does not matter: hydrodynamics.
