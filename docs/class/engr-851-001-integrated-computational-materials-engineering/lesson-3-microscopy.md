# lesson-3-microscopy

- Material Microstructure Characterization Techniques
  - Optical Microscope (OM)
    - This will be used for Final Project
  - Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
    - We are getting one
    - Will also be using for FP
    - Polish before scanning
  - Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM)
    - Do not have one...yet
    - Polish before scanning
  - Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)
    - Also trying to get
  - **Confocal Microscopy**
    - More like an OM
  - Before destroying something, look at it to know what broke
    - X-rays or OM
    - **DO NOT PUT BROKEN PIECES BACK TOGETHER!!!**
      - This ruins the damage surface
- Depth of Field
  - Longitudinal distance between two points measured from the POV
- Resolution
  - Ability to distinguish separate objects as distinct
- Light v Electron Microscope
- Optical Microscope
  - Put a scale bar in images
  - Denoting the scale "100X" is NOT helpful to the reader
  - 100X is only helpful to the guy doing the study; however, it can be included during discussion of the experimentation process
  - You want to find a representative volume element: an element that represents a typical volume of space within specimen
    - May not be first "picture" you take
    - May need to stitch pieces together
    - Bio-materials are really difficult to get good resolution
  - The Effect of Etching
    - Chemical process to enhance certain features of a material
  - Electron Microscope
    - Essentially x-rays being transmitted toward material
    - X-rays help identify a particular section of material as specific chemical elements, because of detection of the number of electrons
    - No one believes the analysis, except the analyst
      - Because he followed the scientific method
    - Everyone believes the experiment, except the experimentalist
      - He can see all the errors
  - SEM
    - Start with the largest length scale and incrementally zoom in
    - This instantly creates publication worthy images
    - This is the point: to write a journal article of the findings
    - Casting pores--point inclusions--are initiators of damage
      - Hydrogen does not allow metal to bond to other things, because it cools too quickly
    - > "Twinning is a change in the crystal lattice structure to accommodate deformation from loading. But it acts as a grain boundary." <cite> Daniel Kenney
    - Magnesium is like swiss cheese, because the front interacts with oxygen first, which is very reactive
      - $MgS_{2}$--magnesium sulfide--solid precipitates from this process
  - TEM
    - Can get into the $\text{\AA}$ length scale of a material
    - Primarily worried about oxides in steels
      - Forms an inhibition layer
      - Use zinc to prevent rusting
      - The inhibition layer can be $<2 nm$ thin, which will affect the stuctural integrity of the whole steel part.
      - Can also depict "texture" which is the crystal lattice structure
  - Is Materials Processing a Deterministic Cause-Effect World or Statistical?
    - Einstien said cause-effect
    - Neils Bohr said statistical
    - Horstemeyer says it is both
    - Materials processing changes structures to produce mechancial properties
      - History of the material--through its materials processing--is important to know, because point of failure is statistically determined from the current point
