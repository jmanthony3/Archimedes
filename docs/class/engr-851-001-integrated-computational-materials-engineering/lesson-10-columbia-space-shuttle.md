1. _STS-107 In-Flight Damage Assessment Process Review_
- Orbiter Element Analyses
- Background
  - The driving failure of this design was that decision were based on money

2.  Debris Assessment Team Make-Up
- This is described as an "out-of-family" problem
- Dr. H was part of the external analysis team

3. Chronology
- Someone had noticed an issue on video cameras
- CRATER was an analytical code (based on Apollo I) and evaluated the failure possibility
  - The guy that designed it had just retired
  - A new guy, fresh out of college, performed the analysis
- Video footage at the time was very much not usable; therefore, EVERYTHING is documented now
- Accident investigation looked at bounding studies: lowest-highest possible speeds, areas of interest

15. Theoretical Basis for Crater

$$
p = \frac{0.0195(\frac{L}{d})^{0.45}(d)(\rho_{p})^{0.27}(V - V*)^{\frac{2}{3}}}{(S_{t})^{\frac{1}{4}}(\rho_{T})^{\frac{1}{6}}}
$$

17. Crater Can Be Used to Assess Debris Impact Issues Prelaunch, In-Flight, and Post-Flight
- Crater uses this equation from Boeing and always used day of launches to determine damage incurred during launch.
- However, when things were outside its scope, it was disregarded

28. Evaluated data was reported by a quiet, analytical, new graduate; his analysis was brushed off

Q&A article
- Did you believe the analysts answers?
  - They were "out-of-family", so it was outside the bounds of Crater
  - Later blamed Crater...and claimed too difficult to perform FEA
- >NASA is "overconfident and engages in self-deception" <cite> MH
- NASA blamed the model: Crater
  - The code was designed around impacts with ice, not large chunks of foam
  - Ignored the views of "low-level engineers"
  - NASA did not call the guy who wrote Crater, because he talked too much
    - Gather external analyses
    - Consult the resident field experts (referring to Adam and Julian asking Dr. Atwater)
- Crater versus Dyna
  - Crater is energy based and Dyna is dynamic force based
- What could they have done?
  - Could have gone to the ISS; however, it could not handle the situation at the time.
  - ISS _NOW_ can because of this issue.

Q: _So what happened?_

A: High velocity impact--high strain-rate event--on a brittle material.
