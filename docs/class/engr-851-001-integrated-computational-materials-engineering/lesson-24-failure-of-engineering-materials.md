2. Effect of Overloads
   1. Striations, because of 2 microns length scale.
   2. Transition in size of striations, because the loading condition changed.
   3. Smaller striations implicates smaller loads.
   4. _Ask Stephen if SEM images are publication worthy._
3. Fractography to understand fatigue history.
   1. Gouges at radial edges.
   2. River marks in center point to failure point.
   3. Beach marks: tougher metals make bigger striations.
   4. What are the types of loads, stress levels, cycles?
## Case Study: Failed C-130 Wheel Flange
- Service life of 20 yrs.
- Inspected each time tire changed with no visible cracks prior to failure.
5. Complex structure of flange. Stress concentrations everywhere.
6. Striations.
7. Ductile fracture voids.
   1. debond in monotonic overload and crack incubates there.
   2. Fatigue striations present, but the last half-cycle might be ductile.
   3. It is not the whole story.

## Howitzer Gun:
- Tough steel and contained enriched uranium.
- $\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ to make high-speed, heavy rods.
- Hardness test to see if material is sufficient for its service conditions.
- A2 tool steel used everywhere: and a manufacture said the hardness was Rc 56.
  - The student found 55-57.
  - Therefore, material was sufficient, and now they had a data sheet.
- Hardness is within spec, and the highest stress was below yield.
- FEA showed 220, but failure would be 270: so no damage.
- SEM showed a lot of white stuff on cross-section; therefore, $t$ is much less and stress would be higher. But is that a manufacturing defect?
- _Conclusion: Material defect within manufactured part._

## Comments for Final Projects
- Connecting Rod:
  - Ready to do destructive testing.
  - Need to redo EDS scan in SEM, because not Beryllium.
  - Confident failure is fatigue.
- Pliers
  - Analytical is going.
    - >Add assumptions to simplify analytical. <cite> MFH.
  - CAD model is difficult to lead into FEA, because of geometry.
  - Not sure what material it is.
    - Before SEM, optical scale might reveal pores if cast metal.
    - Could be carburized surface.
- Write the report as a journal article.
  - Journal article is for reference.
  - And the 12 steps are important.
