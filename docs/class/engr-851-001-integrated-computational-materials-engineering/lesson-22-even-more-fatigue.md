# lesson-22-even-more-fatigue

2. Fatigue failures
   1. Different length scales give different evidence of failure
3. Microscopic can show striations in grains themselves
4. initiation includes: incubation, microstructure crack, and crack tip displacement and its wake
   1. For each defect type, there is a different incubation rate
5. Fatigue in salt water at $90 MPa < 210 MPa$
   1. Focus is a casting pores (smooth surfaces) with hydrogen shrinkage (labyrinth of black dots around casting pore) around it
   2. Ken Gall want to see incubation
   3. Looks like the Cooper picture from before, but with magnesium
   4. This picture showed why energy transfer was not sufficient (MFH, Dave McDowell, and Ken Gall)
      1. Energy dissipation happens at free surface (Thermo II)
      2. Therefore, some energy went into cracks that arrested or branched
      3. Use geometry methods: _strain-life_
6. Different location, same specimen
   1. Persistent slip bands (PSB) within grains along twinning planes, coupled with hydrogen shrinkage
   2. Crack nucleated from interaction of persistent slip bands
7. Within the grain:
   1. More persistent slip bands with more cycles
   2. Eventually, a crack in the grain from the PSB 
9. Crack from PSB starts aligning with the crack in the grain site
   1.  Ultimately coalesce together
   2.  Crack starts earlier for the PSB with a stress field in front of it
10. Multi-Site Fatigue
    1.  All these sites are incubating (babies born)
    2.  Then they coalesce together.
11. White spots are inter-metallics (very brittle)
    1.  Stress corrosion cracking
    2.  No corrosion pits, because the oxidation layers are nanoscale (difficult to see)
12. Magnesium more susceptible to corrosion than aluminum
    1.  Fracture follows the straining from forging
    2.  River marks in the wake of the crack
15. Stress corrosion cracking grounded AC-130's in the 70's
    1.  Fixed by rewinging
    2.  Or bonding
16. Mothballed in '78 by CIA
17. '88: Interior Department buys them: named N-130's
    1.  One crashed in '02
    2.  Amazing it lasted
18. NTSB investigated
    1.  Original design intent: clearly different
    2.  Engineering support
    3.  Know the nominal and abnormal boundary conditions.
    4.  Inspection intervals?
19. Unsafe condition identified likely to exist on other Lockheed C-130's
    1.  Exchange in '88 for museum quality aircraft
    2.  Illegal exchange
    3.  '99 indictments
    4.  C-130's still fly today...
20. USAF Aging problem
    1.  An increase of fleet increases maintenance costs
21. Bonded repairs ('70s)
    1.  Solution to drill a hole in front of crack tip
    2.  Radius is low around crack tip counteracted by the larger notch root radius of the hole
    3.  Maybe swiss cheese is not a good idea
    4.  Bonding...
22. Load spectrum for the C-130
    1.  Unknown service life
    2.  Crack growth is unpredictable
23. Follow the 12 Step Method
    1.  Take pictures and label them
    2.  Can move them to another place to reconstruct the accident
24. Stress intensity factor
    1.  Reduce by gluing on a patch to disperse load by taking some strain from the hole.
    2.  Thermal and traction stresses.
    3.  Tapered to reduces secondary bending and minimize shearing bands
25. Damage tolerance guidelines
    1.  critical cracks cannot be fixed: do not fly the plane
    2.  If no failure at ultimate load, then conservative.
    3.  Better than drilling holes, but what is the efficiency, thermal transfer, how long is it effective, etcetera?
26. Efficiency: Riveted joints to minimize strain along bonding path
28. Repair smaller cracks, because their crack growth rate is less.
    1.  Still allows for damage 
29. Tested two full-scale planes
    1.  One patched
    2.  One unpatched
    3.  Showed patching increased fatigue life with equal, random vibration sessions applied to either specimen
30. -34 Inspection interval halves while crack grows
    1.  Crack follows unpatched trend, but is displaced after each patch.
    2.  Minimizes the slope of the crack growth rate over service life.
    3.  If optimally designed, then planes would failure later, but all fail in the same way.
    4.  _Redundancy_
36. What should have been done?
    1.  Could never have been flown again.
    2.  Or permanently repaired.

Fatigue is obviously a problem, but the Air Force is moving to adopt the damage.

**Q: Why not replace parts in place?**
_A: AM parts hospital to print parts in place. But too much porosity reduces strength compared to wrought/forged materials. All coupled with thermal/mechanical with chemistry for diffusion/solidification processes._
