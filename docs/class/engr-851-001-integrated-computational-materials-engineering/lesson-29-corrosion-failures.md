# lesson-29-corrosion-failures

1. Commonly in the F/A 18 fighter
2. Background
   1. Safe-life uses crack length until failure
   2. US thought it was from static overload
3. Non-destructive evaluation (NDE)
   1. Dye penetrant
   2. Eddy current: measures crack by variations in magnetic waves.
   3. Found pitting and beach marks: the pit reached some length and existed for some time.
4. Chemical analysis revealed $Cl^{1-}$ attracted to $Al^{3+}$.
5. Fractography
   1. Striations indicate fatigue, necessary to it, but not sufficient.
   2. Pits without striations is not the whole story.
   3. Corrosion, fatigue, and stress loads.
6. Mechanical Testing
   1. Crack growth rate increases in corrosive environment for low-frequencies: corrosion fatigue
7. Corrosion and degradation
   1. Why does corrosion occur?
   2. What metals are most likely to corrode?
   3. How do temperatures and environment affect corrosion rate?
   4. How do we suppress corrosion?
8. Businesses do not like preventing corrosion, because of the high upfront costs.

9. Length scales differ.
   1.  Galvanizing: the difference of electronegativity in dissimilar metals.
   2.  Allowed chemical reactions. If in a corrosive environment, chemistry happens quicker.
   3.  Pitting looks like a void the size of a particle, because chemistry happened at that particle.
       1.  This reduces cross-sectional area.
       2.  Also includes a notch root stress concentrator.
       3.  _Mercury Marine_ boat motors made of magnesium (the most anodic element) never corrodes, because they pass electricity through the entire motor. Yes this does sound like an explosion waiting to happen.
       4.  Mechanical types: general/uniform, intergranular, and pitting.

10. Galvanic reactions happen between two dissimilar metals, which corrode at different rates. This does not mean they do not corrode, only at different rates. The electronegativity of a chemical bond is not obvious, but surely a pattern exists.

11. Stress corrosion cracking: not fully understood yet.
    1.   Cracking induced from combined influences of tensile stress and corrosive environment.
    2.   Impact between dry cracking and fatigue threshold.

12. Increasing "T-speeds" is stress, where the "T" is triaxiality.
