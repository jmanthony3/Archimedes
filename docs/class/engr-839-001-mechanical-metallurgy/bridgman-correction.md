# Bridgman Correction

This only applies to *cylindrical* samples, because sample area and neck radius must be known.

$$\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{\sigma_{avg}}{(1 + 2\frac{R}{r_{n}})ln(1 + \frac{r_{n}}{2R})}
\end{equation}$$

$R$ is radius of curvature of the neck, and $r_{n}$ is the cross-sectional radius at thinnest part of neck.
The further away from necking (higher strains), this correction factor increases.
