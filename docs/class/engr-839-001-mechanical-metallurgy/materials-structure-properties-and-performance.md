*[CPSPP]: Chemistry-Process-Structure-Property-Performance

**Definitions**
This class will make more familiar the "chemistry-process-structure" portion of the *chemistry-process-structure-property-performance*" ( #CPSPP ) relationship.
LU seeks to apply these engineering disciplines into entrepreneurship.

Mechanical
: Force response of materials, which includes the underlying principles/effects of microstructure.

Metallurgy
: Microstructural transformations dictated by composition/processing that is the foundation.

Mechanical Metallurgy
: As a course, studies not *how* materials behave, by *why* they behave a certain way.

!!! info Syllabus
    Homeworks due only before the relevant exams, and graded for the good ol' college try.
    If you can do the homeworks, then you can do the tests.
    **Final Exam is cumulative.**
    Critical Review: "Reverse engineer" an article and explain it with additional comments or inferences.
    The accompanying presentation should explain the takeaway from the application articles/comments.

## Review
!!! summary #CPSPP
    Relationship for how some chemical composition (e.g: FeC) is processed to produce some structure, which has some property that allows some performance.

| Microstructures in FeC #phase-diagram. #phase-diagram packs a lot of information for CPS of #CPSPP sequence. Lines denote what structure is found after some process with some chemical composition, which can be found by the [Lever Rule](lever-rule.md). |

Lever Rule
: Ratio of phases proportional to weight percent distance to other phases.

    Simple cubic ( #sc ), face-center cubic ( #fcc ), body-center cubic ( #bcc ), hexagonal close-packed ( #hcp ).
    - The atomic packing factor, #apf, the ratio lattice that is filled, increases down this list.
    - #fcc and #hcp are similar, but #hcp is more #brittle.

**Monolithic**
Previously explained as #homogeneous or #isotropic, but depends on length scale.
Here, means the same #crystal-structure throughout: e.g. #pearlite.

**Materials Design**
Exposed to variety of conditions, but can be designed to suit.
More complex designs may have better performance.
Composites have "rules-of-mixtures" to balance performance.
Hierarchical materials vary structure/composition to enhance functional/structural properties at different length scales.

**Our Focus:**
not on manufacturing techniques: e.g. ENGR 835.
Will consider how manufacturing variables affect structure.
We will move up length up from #atomistic-length-scale.

## Metallic Crystal Structure

### Energy and Packing
| ![](../../../attachments/engr-839-001-mechanical-metallurgy/nondense_interatomic_potential_curve_210906_203334_EST.png) | ![](../../../attachments/engr-839-001-mechanical-metallurgy/dense_interatomic_potential_curve_210906_203436_EST.png) |
|:--:|:--:|
| Non-dense, random packing. | Dense, ordered packing. |

Ordered structures tend to be nearer the minimum bonding energy and are more stable.

**Atomic Packing**
Dense #crystal-structure for metals.
Reasons for dense packing:
1. Bonds between metal atoms are non-directional; 
2. #nearest-neighbor distances tend to be small in order to lower bond energy;
3. High degree of shielding (of ion cores) provided by free electron cloud; and,
4. #crystal-structure for metals simpler than structures for ceramics and polymers.

## Density Comparison of Materials
| ![](../../../attachments/engr-839-001-mechanical-metallurgy/density_comparison_of_materials_210906_205030_EST.png) |
|:--:|
| In general, $\rho_{metals} > \rho_{ceramics} > \rho_{polymers}$ |


### Polycrystalline Materials
| ![](../../../attachments/engr-839-001-mechanical-metallurgy/polycrystalline_example_210906_205257_EST.png) |
|:--:|
| Higher cooling rates at edges make for smaller #grains; whereas, slower cooling rate at center make for larger, directionally aligned #grains. |

*Most* engineering materials are composed of many, small single crystals.
Each "grain" is a #single-crystal.
#grain-size typically range from 1 nm to 2 cm.
Smaller #grains usually mean higher strength and less #ductile.

| ![](../../../attachments/engr-839-001-mechanical-metallurgy/unit_cell_orientation_in_polycrystal_210906_205554_EST.png) |
|:--:|
| Same crystal type that repeat in different orientations. |

### Crystal Structure and Deformation
#planar-density determine #slip-planes: the more dense, the easier to move.
#unit-cell represents #single-crystal, but the behavior of that structure is not equivalent in all directions.
Permanently deforming materials requires that atoms must shift over one another: *#slip-planes*.
Closely packed (high #apf) do not have to move as much to get by one another.
Not all #slip-directions...
#fcc materials are generally #ductile, because of few #slip-system and one #slip-planes.
Not many preferred directions to #slip and few preferred: e.g. 48 spoons to cut a steak does not equal cutting with a knife.
More of a bad thing does not outweigh few good things.
#coordination-number is the number of #nearest-neighbor atoms.


### Slip System (fcc)
| ![](../../../attachments/engr-839-001-mechanical-metallurgy/fcc_slip_system_210830_184833_EST.png) |
|:--:|
| **#slip-system is ${111}<110>$.** #dislocation-motion on ${111}$ planes. #dislocation-motion in $<110>$ directions. 12 independent #slip-system for #fcc. |


| ![](../../../attachments/engr-839-001-mechanical-metallurgy/visual_example_of_slip_210830_184900_EST.png) |
|:--:|
| More force over more distance = more work to move #bcc than #fcc, which requires less distance because closely packed (dense). |


### Polycrystalline Slip
Many grains, often with random #crystallographic directions.
Orientation of #slip-planes and #slip-directions, $(\phi, \lambda)$ vary from grain to grain.
On application of stress, #slip in #grains on most favorable #slip-system.
With largest $T_{R}$. When $T_{R} > T_{crss}$.

| ![](../../../attachments/engr-839-001-mechanical-metallurgy/impact_deformed_monel_210907_142431_EST.png) |
|:--:|
| Edge of indent shows texture from #slip-planes from moving atoms out of the way of impact. Accumulates with amount of deformation applied. |

## Summary
Important to have common understanding of vocabulary to describe #crystal-structure.
We focus on *#bcc*, *#fcc*, and *#hcp* structures.
[Miller indices](miller-indices.md) give exact orientation or active atoms/planes to determine the associated properties.
The #apf is import to density and #slip-system, but it is not the only critical property.
