# necking

Occurs when localized deformation begins to dominate the strain: *[void nucleation, coalescence, and growth](../engr-743-001-damage-and-fracture/void-nucleation-coalescence-and-growth.md)*.
This is also known as *#plastic-instability* and is defined by **#Considere-Criterion**: increase in stress relative to strain ([work-hardening](deformation-and-work-hardening.md)) reaching a maximum in the engineering #stress-strain-curve.
*The higher the strain exponent, the more strain you get out of the material.*
Using this #Considere-Criterion, substituting true stress-strain into the derivative and apply [Ludwik-Hollomann](ludwik-hollomann-hardening.md), you get the relationship $\epsilon_{u} = n$, where $\epsilon_{n}$ is maximum, uniform #plastic-strain.

[Work-hardening](deformation-and-work-hardening.md) exponent from *engineering* stress-strain curve.
[work-hardening](deformation-and-work-hardening.md) decreases during increase of #plastic-strain until that point at which [necking](necking.md) occurs.
A metal unable to work-harden immediately reaches the point of [necking](necking.md) after yielding, which is consistent with equations.

[Work-Softening](work-softening.md)
: The more it deforms, the easier it can be deformed (not necessarily from reduced area)--is possible under extreme conditions.
