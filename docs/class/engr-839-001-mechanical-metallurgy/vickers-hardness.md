# Vickers Hardness

Also known as *Diamond Pyramid*, because indenter is pyramid with $136\degree$, which is based on $d_{Brinell} = 0.375D$ relationship.
Can be used on any material.
Indentation size measured by average length across diagonals.
Hardness computed by...
$$\begin{equation}
HV = \frac{2Psin(\frac{\alpha}{2})}{d^{2}} \approx = \frac{1.8544P}{d^{2}}
\end{equation}$$
