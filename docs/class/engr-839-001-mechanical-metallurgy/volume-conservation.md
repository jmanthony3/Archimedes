# Volume Conservation

Volume is assumed to be constant through #deformation; however, volume is not always assumed constant in the elastic region.
*[Poisson's Ratio](../engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/poissons-ratio.md)]*, $\nu$ is constant in the elastic region, but varies in the plastic region.
True and engineering #stress-strain considered equivalent up to elastic region.
