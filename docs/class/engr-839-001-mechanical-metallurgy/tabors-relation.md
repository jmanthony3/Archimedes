# Tabor's Relation

A way to relate measured Vickers hardness value to yield stress of material.

$$\begin{equation}
H = 3\sigma_{y}
\end{equation}$$

This assumes no [[work-hardening]]; therefore, use $\epsilon_{p} = \frac{d'}{5D} \approx 0.075$ for $d = 0.375D$ with a flow stress, $\tau = 8-10 \%$ in hardness conversions.
