# Schmid Factor

Combination of slip direction and plane angles is known as the Schmid Factor, M

$$\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\tau_{c} &= \sigma_{0}\sin(\chi)\cos(\lambda) = M\sigma_{0} \\
M &= \sin(\chi)\cos(\lambda) = \cos(\phi)\cos(\lambda)
\end{split}
\end{equation}$$

Yield stress is minimized at $45\degree$ for both angles: i.e. M = 0.5.
This is good for #hcp because of few, ideal slip systems.
