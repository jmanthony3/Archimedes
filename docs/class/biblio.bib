Bearing in mind that both the macroscopic and the microstructure surface characteristics strongly affect the mechanical structures' functionality, it is essential to carefully study the surface state of treated components. To assess the surface roughness evolution induced by shot peening, a 3D finite element model of the process is used to investigate surface topography alterations as a function of peening parameters and processing time. Discrete data obtained from the numerical simulations are subsequently elaborated to calculate the conventional roughness parameters. The results obtained from the numerical simulations, correspond quite well with the roughness values measured experimentally on shot peened specimens. It is indicated that the developed numerical model provides an efficient estimation of surface characteristics of shot peened specimens, in terms of surface roughness parameters and thus can be used to properly select the peening parameters considering the eventual surface roughness.},

The main purpose of the present work is to suggest strategies capable of making connection between the process conditions and the fatigue strength. In the present paper, fatigue lives of shot-peened parts were predicted. A new multiaxial HCF model, based on the Crossland criterion, was proposed; it integrates the favourable effects of shot peening that are the combined effect of compressive residual stresses and strain hardening. The plastic strain field accounts for the strain hardening. In order to compute residual stress and equivalent plastic strain profiles due to the repeated impacts, we have modelled and simulated, through a finite element method, the impact of the shot dynamics resulting from the process. The relaxation of induced compressive residual stresses, over the fatigue life, has been considered. For the purpose of spotlighting the capability of the present methodology, the predictions were compared with existing experimental data. This study demonstrates that the single effect of stabilized residual stress is not sufficient to explain the full enhancement of fatigue resistance. The proposed fatigue criterion provides a conservative prediction in terms of endurance limit.},

In this work, a shot-peening test rig that can propel single shot under the process conditions with a high aiming accuracy is presented. The test rig propels industrial shot by sudden pressurised gas release. A methodology to recover the propelled shot three-dimensional trajectory within a 200-{$\mu$}m accuracy using two high-frequency cameras is developed in an open-source in-house code. The test rig can propel 0.5-, 1.19- and 2.5-mm-diameter shot at velocity ranging from 0.8 to 143 m s{$^{-1}$} and can send several shots at the same position when using the largest shot diameter. Two potential applications of the set-up are presented for (i) coefficient of restitution measurement with different shooting angles and velocities and (ii) crystal plasticity finite element model validation using the impact dent topology, the shot displacement curve and the crystal misorientation field under the dent.},

The review found that the developed numerical models coupling finite elements with discrete elements became increasingly mature and showed their advantages in incorporating flow behaviour and randomness of shots. High emphasis must be placed on the constitutive equations of target material where its strain-rate sensitivity, cyclic behaviour and Bauschinger effects are recommended to be incorporated in the numerical material model simultaneously since considering one of them in isolation may lead to unreliable distribution of residual stresses. Furthermore, material hardening is a critical benefit of shot peening; however, it has not received its deserved attention from the existing investigations, neither in simulation nor in optimisation. The study found that intensity and coverage are two critical control parameters recommended to be constraints for optimisation of shot peening. Finally, this work also found that developed heuristic algorithms, such as genetic algorithms have recently showed their advantages for searching optimal combinations of peening parameters. It is plausible that in the near future, the synergy of combining these algorithms with approximation models can be expected to gain more attention by researchers.},

Electron back scatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis, full width at half maximum (FWHM) evaluations and compressive residual stress (CRS) measurements showed that the deformed layer structure was converted into a nanocrystallized and compressively stressed zone via SSP and UNSM. The hardness on the topmost layer was effectively enhanced by UNSM~+~SSP and SSP~+~UNSM processes.

The majority of the controlling parameters of the process have been taken into account. The shot peening loading has been characterised by using energy equivalence between the dynamic impact and a static indentation of a peening shot in the treated surface. The behaviour of the subjected material is supposed to be elastic plastic with damage. An integrated law of the damage proposed by Lema\^itre and Chaboche has been used. The proposed model leads to obtain the residual stress, the plastic deformation profiles and the surface damage. An application on a shot peened Ni-based super alloy Waspaloy has been carried out. The comparison of the residual stresses, obtained by X-ray diffraction method and by finite element calculation, shows a good correlation. The in-depth profile of the plastic deformations and the superficial damage values are in good agreement with the experimental observations.},

At the same time however, it is the most missing parameter in the finite element simulations of this process. This study aims to relate shot peening simulation to the actual coverage that is developed during the process. Accordingly, two important models from literature are re-simulated and their capability to predict an actual coverage is assessed. Results of this study illustrate that full coverage situation is not captured by these models. Thereafter, a random finite element simulation along with a step by step examination of the treated surface is adopted in order to present an actual coverage evolution. Application of Avrami equation in order to adopt an appropriate number of impingements in simulation to achieve a given coverage for a given target area is examined. According to the result, application of this equation in simulation leads to an overestimation of impingement numbers at full coverage level unless the radius of treated are is at least ten times of the radius of a single indentation.},

Numerous analytical, numerical, and experimental studies have been made to better understand the effects of various peening parameters on the final material state and to predict deformed shapes, but conclusions were often limited to trends. The purpose of this study is therefore to develop and verify experimentally quantitative numerical tools for peen forming applications by studying the simple case of peening an Almen-sized AA-2024 aluminium strip in an Almen holder. The first step consisted in improving an existing random dynamic model by determining optimal dimensions. The AA-2024 target mechanical behaviour was characterized experimentally and a combined isotropic-kinematic hardening law was selected to model the material behaviour. The dynamic impact model and material constitutive law provided good prediction of peening-induced stresses in thick AA-2024 for two shot velocities. The sequence-sensitive aspect of the forming process was also investigated and a new shell-based finite element model was proposed. Numerical and experimental results for three shot velocities were compared to evaluate the validity of this numerical simulation method and promising agreement was observed.},

The relationship between surface roughness and the magnitude of the stress can be affected by peening media size or the extent of peening. Generally, an ideal condition from shot peening would be a high compressive residual stress and a low surface roughness, but these tend to be inversely related. This study proposes a method for decreasing roughness and increasing residual stress concurrently using a distribution of shot sizes in a single shot peening passage based on finite element modeling that has been calibrated using by experimental results. Numerical models predict mixed shot sizes will create a smoother surface than using monodispersed shot at 100 \% coverage. The residual stress profile for mixed shot sizes showed a broad range of compressive residual stresses in comparison with the largest impact ball size. This newly proposed method can improve the surface quality and the extent of the compressive residual stresses in a single-shot peening passage.},

The present article establishes a framework for predictive modeling of shot velocity. The predicted shot velocities were in good agreement with published experimental results. The present results clearly show that once the shot material and its size are known, the velocity shot depends directly on Almen intensity. For a given combination of shot size, material, and peening angle, an increase in Almen intensity involves an increase in shot velocity. As a further demonstration of the capabilities of the proposed approach, we have found a relationship between Almen intensity and shot velocity.},

However, the flow stress also highly depends on many other factors such as strain path, strain rate and temperature history. Only a model that includes all of these pertinent factors is capable of predicting complex stress state in material deformation. In this paper, the commonly used phenomenological plasticity models (Johnson\textendash Cook, Usui, etc.) to characterize material behavior in forming and machining were critically reviewed. Although these models are easy to apply and can describe the general response of material deformation, these models lack the mechanisms to reflect static and dynamic recovery and the effects of load path and strain rate history in large deformation processes. These effects are essential to understand process mechanisms, especially surface integrity (residual stress, microhardness, and microstructure) of the manufactured products. As such a dislocation-based internal state variable (ISV) plasticity model was used, in which the evolution equations enable the prediction of strain rate history and temperature history effects. These effects can be quite large and cannot be modeled by the equation-of-state models that assume that stress is a unique function of the total strain, strain rate, and temperature, independent of the loading path. The temperature dependence of the hardening and recovery functions results in the prediction of thermal softening during adiabatic temperatures rises, which are common in metal forming and machining. The dynamic mechanical behaviors of three different benchmark work materials, titanium Ti-6Al-4V, AISI 52100 steel (62 HRc), and aluminum 6061-T6, were modeled using the ISV approach. The material constants were obtained by using a nonlinear regression-fitting algorithm in which the stress\textendash strain curves from the model were correlated to the experiments at different (extreme) temperatures.

Effects of various parameters on the residual stress field induced by low plasticity burnishing have been investigated by many researchers. However, initial residual stresses induced by machining are one of the important factors which affect the residual stress regenerated by the LPB process. The present work aims to develop an analytical model which takes into account the initial residual stress and burnishing parameters to predict residual stress field of workpiece material Inconel 718 based on Hertz contact theory and elastic\textendash plastic theory. Initial residual stress fields were produced by turning of Inconel 718 and were measured by using X-ray diffraction technique. Two types of material constitutive models such as the linear hardening model and isotropic\textendash kinematic model were employed to describe the elastic\textendash plastic behavior of workpiece material Inconel 718. An analytical study was performed to analyze the effect of the initial residual stress field and burnishing parameters on residual stress induced by low plastic burnishing. The results of analytical model were verified by conducting the LPB experiments on initial turned Inconel 718. The results showed that the shape and magnitude of the residual stress field obtained with considering the effect of initial residual stress field was in good accordance with experimental measurements.}

  abstract = {Using a modified 3D random representative volume (RV) finite element model, the effects of model dimensions (impact region and interval between impact and representative regions), model shapes (rectangular, square, and circular), and peening-induced thermal softening on resultant critical quantities (residual stress, Almen intensity, coverage, and arc height) after shot peening are systematically examined. A new quantity, i.e., the interval between impact and representative regions, is introduced and its optimal value is first determined to eliminate any boundary effect on shot peening results. Then, model dimensions are respectively assessed for all model shapes to reflect the actual shot peening process, based on which shape-independent critical shot peening quantities are obtained. Further, it is found that thermal softening of the target material due to shot peening leads to variances of the surface residual stress and arc height, demonstrating the necessity of considering the thermal effect in a constitutive material model of shot peeing. Our study clarifies some of the finite element modeling aspects and lays the ground for accurate modeling of the SP process.},

In this paper, the various techniques available for modelling the effect of peening with finite elements are discussed. In particular, a method of simulating the effect of peening on large flexible panels is presented. Analyses are shown in which a novel loading is applied to finite element meshes in order to produce the desired residual stress distribution.

The experimental evaluation of shot peening mechanism is very difficult and costly. On the other hand, numerical simulations allow a parametric study of shot peening process and provide an insight into the mechanism, subject to the selection of an appropriate material model and numerical procedure. LS-DYNA code was employed for the numerical simulation in this work. The modeling of shot peening process was accomplished by simulation of multiple shot impacts on a target plate at different velocities. From the simulations, the compressive residual stress profiles were obtained and the effects of velocity and peening coverage were investigated. The results showed that, residual stress distribution was highly dependent on impact velocity and multiplicity. A uniform state of stress was achieved at a particular shots number which was found to be 25 in this work. The shots number corresponding to the state of uniform stress was not the same as that related to the maximum compressive residual stress which may occur at lower number of shots. Impact velocity significantly influences the residual stress profile. The increase of velocity improves the residual stress distribution up to a particular point. Further increase in the velocity may reduce the maximum residual stress. A close agreement between the numerical residual stress profiles obtained in this work was achieved with the experimental profiles reported by Torres and Voorwald.},

Finite element (FE) dynamic simulations proved to be a reliable tool to estimate the effect of the main treatment parameters on surface roughness and residual stresses. This paper presents one of the first attempts to numerically simulate a micro-shot peening treatment; indeed, this is a tremendous numerical challenge given the large number of impacts to be simulated and the fine mesh needed to discretize the small impact dimples. The target material is the aeronautical aluminium grade Al-7075-T651. To best represent the hardening rule of the target material, the Lemaitre-Chaboche model is tuned on the basis of fully reverse axial strain tests. The statistical nature of the peening treatment is taken into account by randomly generating sets of bead individuals characterized by stochastic variability in dimension, velocity and impact location. Surface roughness and residual stresses resulting from the numerical analyses are compared with experimental measurements. A specific novel procedure is proposed to take into account the effect of surface roughness and radiation penetration on the in-depth residual stress profile measured by XRD. In addition, a static finite element model is devised to estimate the concentration effect exerted by the surface roughness on the external stress field.},

One of the main obstacles, encountered in the past years, to welding application within the aircraft industries were due to failure in the weldments, caused by high tensile residual stresses present in the region of the weld, reducing drastically fatigue strength of welded joints. Improvement in the fatigue life of the welded joint can be obtained if compressive residual stresses are introduced at the weld region. Shot peening is a manufacturing process intended to give aircraft structures the final shape and to introduce a compressive residual state of stress inside the material in order to increase fatigue life. This paper presents the modeling and simulation of the residual stress field resulting from the shot peening process. The results achieved show that a significant decrease of welding induced tensile residual stress magnitude can be obtained. Good agreement between experimental and numerical results was achieved.},

However, the same Almen intensity may be obtained by using small shots impacting the surface at high velocity or by using large shots impacting the surface at low velocity. This paper describes a model for predicting Almen intensity based on an analytical model for shot peening residual stresses. Theoretical results for different sets of peening parameters were consistent with published experimental results and revealed that although different combinations of shot peening parameters can produce the same Almen intensity, each combination resulted in a different through thickness residual stress distribution.},

The influences of peening velocity and peening time on the resulting residual stress profiles have been experimentally presented. The quantitative relationships between the prebending moment and the resulting arc heights of narrow strips and square strips have been experimentally investigated. Experimental results show that with the increases of the prebending moment, the resulting arc height following the prebending direction increases and the tendency is almost linear.

  abstract = {Shot peening is a cold-working process that is used mainly to improve the fatigue life of metallic components. Experimental investigation of the mechanisms involved in shot peening is very expensive and complicated. Therefore, the Finite Element (FE) method has been recognized as an effective mean for characterizing the shot peening process and several types of FE models have been developed to evaluate the effects of shot peening parameters. However, in most of the existing FE models, the shot peening sequence and impact location were defined a priori. It is therefore the purpose of this study to consider the random property of the shot peening process. A novel 3D FE model with multiple randomly distributed shots was developed combining a Matlab program with the ANSYS preprocessor. The explicit solver LS-DYNA has been used to simulate the dynamic impingement process. Several potential applications of this novel model such as: the quantitative relationship of the peening intensity, coverage and roughness with respect to the number of shots have been presented. Moreover, simulations with multiple oblique impacts have been carried out in order to compare with results from normal impingements. Our work shows that such a computing strategy can help understanding and predicting the shot peening results better than conventional FE simulations.},

For this purpose, a three dimensional numerical model is developed, comprising the target plate and a number of shot impacts; their number is defined as the minimum required for a realistic simulation and minimum computational cost. The numerical model is verified by comparing the predicted residual stress (RS) fields to experimental. A parametric study of the shot velocity and impinging angle on the CSP products is performed for 4 shot types, i.e. S110, S230, S330 and S550. The main advantages of the present numerical model are: a) the relatively high number of shots introduced in the simulation compared to other publications that use only one shot, b) the number of shots dependency on the desired coverage, c) the thorough selection of numerical parameters, d) the high-strain rate material behaviour used for the target plate, e) the capability to calculate CSP effects on the target plate as function of coverage, f) the computed data which include RS field, surface roughness, cold work and geometrical stress concentration factor (Kt) and finally g) the computed results which are validated by experimental measurements.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional non-steady state shot peening simulation platform for coverage prediction is developed based on commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) ANSYS-FLUENT software. To simulate the air\textendash peen flow, the airflow is treated as a continuum phase governed by the Reynolds-averaged Navier\textendash Stokes conservation equations, while the peen is taken as a discrete phase in which the trajectories of the peens are tracked individually. Two-way air\textendash peen interactions are solved by exchanging mutual momentum during the peening process. User Defined Functions (UDFs) for particle loading distribution in the nozzle, particle dispersion, particle rebound, and nozzle movement are developed and incorporated into ANSYS-FLUENT. A numerical procedure based on the Eulerian\textendash Lagrangian approaches is used in the solution. The air\textendash peen simulation results based on the above model and numerical procedure is found to be in excellent agreement with the literature experimental data. For coverage prediction, both single dimple area and multiple impact coverage models are developed and validated by both experimental data and in-house Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation result. The obtained simulation results for coverage are in good agreement with existing experimental data. In addition, the simulations for two other configurations, that is, round-flat and airfoil NACA0012 specimens, are also performed to demonstrate the capability of the simulation platform. The present work shows that the multiphase shot peening simulation platform developed here can be used to accurately predict air\textendash peen flow and coverage and to further optimize shot peening processes under real operating conditions.},

Five eigenstrain methods were validated and compared in terms of their predictive power. A database of laser peened Aluminium Alloy 7075 flat plates was used to validate the methods. Three methods actually yielded results. Although none of these methods was categorically found to be the best, Coratella's method was rated as the best, based on its performance statistics. In addition, it is the simplest and quickest method from those tested. This method was used in the second part of the project.  The insensitivity of eigenstrains to geometry was also tested, using simple benchmark geometries, representative of features commonly encountered in engineering. These benchmark samples were previously generated in a research collaboration with the US Air Force Research Laboratory, University of Dayton Research Institute, and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Generally, the assumption was found to hold, except when the peened surface is a sharp edge.  The second part of the project aimed to study the effects of component geometry on LSP-induced residual stresses, in commonly encountered geometric features in engineering. The geometries selected were cuboid samples, spheres, cylinders, fillets, structural angles, and channels. A sample was chosen from the database of peened AA7075 samples to be the basis of this study. The eigenstrain distribution was extracted from this sample and imposed on various parameter combinations of the aforementioned geometries. The aim was to study the effects of specifically chosen geometric parameters on the residual stresses due to LSP.  A critical assumption made in the second part of the project was that LSP-induced eigenstrains are insensitive to geometric parameters. This assumption was based on the Principal of Transferability of Eigenstrain. Concern was raised regarding whether this principal holds for thin or small samples. It was hypothesised that for thin/small samples, the attenuation of the LSP-induced shock wave might be modified, leading to a different eigenstrain distribution. This concern is not universal, but limited to some specific parameters. Nevertheless, a study was conducted confirming the Principle of Transferability of Eigenstrain, showing that the assumption of insensitivity of eigenstrain to geometry holds, at least in some circumstances. Similar studies in literature affirm this.  The method has a weakness in predicting residual stresses through peened edges. This was attributed to the overlapping of different peened zones that occurs when peening over an edge, as well as the effect of the edge on the underlying eigenstrain distribution.  It was found that the residual stresses arising from LSP are insensitive to size in larger components. For smaller geometries, the residual stresses vary with changing size of the geometry but they tend to converge to specific values. It was also found that the maximum tensile stresses decrease with increasing size, and maximum compressive stresses tend to increase with increasing size, though this  1  is not always the case. These two facts seem to indicate that LSP has a more positive effect on larger components than smaller ones.  At the outset, it was envisaged that eigenstrain methods would be used to optimise the LSP process for actual components in industrial applications. While in principle, the method studied in this project may meet this need, there are some weaknesses that need to be overcome before it is fit for such a purpose. Recommendations are made on some steps that may overcome these weaknesses and on how this method could possibly be used in conjunction with other methods to achieve this purpose.},

The importance of this analysis is based on the fact that mechanical elements under shot peening are also subjected to manufacturing processes, which convert raw material into finished product. However, material is not provided in a virgin state, it has a previous loading history caused by the manner it is fabricated. This condition could alter some beneficial aspects of the residual stress induced by shot peening and could accelerate the crack nucleation and propagation progression. Studies were performed in beams subjected to strain hardening in tension (5{$\epsilon$}y) before shot peening was applied. Latter results were then compared in a numerical assessment of an induced residual stress field by shot peening carried out in a component (beam) without any previous loading history. In this paper, it is clearly shown the detrimental or beneficial effect that previous loading history can bring to the mechanical component and how it can be controlled to improve the mechanical behavior of the material.},

  abstract = {Surface nanostructuration of metallic components has attracted significant interest since the end of the 1980s, owing to its ability to increase the material hardness, yield stress, fatigue life, and corrosion resistance. Ultrasonic shot peening is one of the commonly used surface nanostructuration methods, which is derived from the conventional shot peening process. It induces multi-directional impacts with a relatively low bead speed, which enhance the surface integrity and facilitate the microstructural changes caused by the surface treatment. Thus, the development of a reliable model of multi-impacts on a microscopic scale would allow more accurate prediction of the resulting microstructural modifications. The currently used finite element models utilize the crystal plasticity laws based on the dislocation dynamics to analyze possible microstructural surface changes (including crystal rotations and variations of the dislocation density) under multiple normal and oblique impacts. First, the evolution of a local misorientation field under a single normal impact, quantified by the kernel average misorientation, was studied both experimentally and theoretically. After that, the proposed crystal plasticity formulation was used to quantify the effect of the material microstructure on the residual compressive stress induced by multiple impacts. As expected, the value of the maximum compressive stress was not changed after few impacts. In addition, particular attention was paid to the evolution of the dislocation density and disorientations inside the grains. The obtained results indicate that in contrast to the normal impacts, the oblique impacts did not significantly modify the compressive residual stress, but strongly affected the metal microstructure near the surface in terms of its disorientation and dislocation density.},

As the ball rolls along the surface it produces a unique combination of three physical effects in the surface layer: i) work hardening and increased hardness, ii) burnishing and decreased roughness, and iii) increased compressive residual stresses. This process has gained an increasingly great attention in automotive, aerospace, and especially medical device manufacturing industries. However, most of the research in hydrostatic burnishing has been performed experimentally and there is still lack of numerical studies providing fundamental understanding of the mechanics and the way process parameters interact with surface integrity characteristics particularly surface roughness and residual stresses. Understanding the correlation between process parameters and surface integrity is critical in efficiently adjusting the surface integrity in order to achieve proper biodegradation rate in human body after implantation. In this study, the dynamic mechanical behavior of the material is simulated using internal state variable (ISV) plasticity model. A semi-infinite, two-dimensional, plane strain FE model is developed and the ISV material model is incorporated into it using a user defined material subroutine. The effects of burnishing pressure and feed on surface roughness and residual stresses are investigated. The simulation results are validated with experimental measurements of residual stresses and surface roughness.},

  abstract = {Shot peening process is widely used to impose compressive residual stresses in fatigue critical surfaces, and its intensity estimated empirically by inserting Almen strips near the intended target and measuring their post-peening curvature. It becomes difficult to calculate the intended residual stress profile in the target from the strip curvature as it depends on the dynamic response of the target material. This paper presents an elasto-plastic numerical approach to investigate effects of process parameters and surface material response on the development of subsurface residual stress. This 3D pseudo-dynamic explicit model is validated by single-ball dropping experiment from literature, and applied to the design of parameters for multi-shot peeing of hardened steel surface.},

  abstract = {Shot peening is a method widely used to improve mechanical properties of materials. The improvement in mechanical properties such as surface hardness, fatigue strength, tensile strength, damping etc. are due to the induction of compressive residual stress in the metal parts. The residual compressive stress induced by shot peening is the function of material and mechanical conditions. Its beneficial effects are mainly due to the residual stress field caused by the plastic deformation of the surface layer of material resulting from multiple impacts of the shot, although strain hardening and grain distortion caused by the multiple impacts of the shot also play a role in the modified mechanical behaviour of the peened components. Due to several advantages shot peening has been in the focus of research persons for the purpose of increasing the properties of the materials. In the present paper, a review study has been done on the shot peening effects on different materials. This review will help the researchers and readers to better understand the several benefits and applications of shot peening. The present review of shot peening process is focused on the latest development and pushes the readers towards the on-going research in this classic process. The authors have not come across any such type of review which focuses mainly on shot peening process.},

The process consists of projecting high-velocity particles onto a metallic surface. This study introduces a new, and experimentally validated, sequentially coupled Discrete Element Model (DEM) - Finite Element Model (FEM) to predict the process' effects in terms of residual stresses and roughness. A shot stream was first simulated in DEM to obtain the velocity distribution of impacting shots. The target's progressive hardening was accounted for by adjusting the Coefficients of Restitution (CoRs) for shot-target interactions as the number of impacts evolved through a meshless method. The extracted impacting shots were then impinged onto a representative cell in a dynamic FEM model to evaluate the shot peening effects. The simulations were compared against experimentally measured roughness and residual stresses at full coverage. The study shows that using a constant average CoR yields results that are quite similar to those with an evolving CoRs, for a fraction of the computational cost. Moreover, cases where shot-shot interactions were accounted for yielded lower residual stresses and roughness than cases where such interactions were not accounted for. Nevertheless, all simulated cases delivered simulations that were in good agreement with the experiments, which validates the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Shot peening is a cold-working process that induces a small indentation on a metallic surface by impacting shots onto it causing residual compressive stresses which delays the initiation of fatigue cracking. The experimental assessment of shot-peening process parameters is not only very complex but costly as well. The most promising technique is the explicit dynamics finite-element (FE) analysis capable of determining the shot-peening process parameters subject to the selection of a suitable material's constitutive model and numerical technique. In this work, Ansys/LS-Dyna code was employed to simulate the impact of shots of various sizes made of steel and glass on an aluminium alloy plate defined with strain-rate-sensitive elasto-plastic material model. The impacts were carried out at various incident velocities. The effects of velocity, size, and material of the shots on the compressive residual stress, indentation, and force\textendash time response were investigated. The results showed that impact with the steel shots caused more indentation and larger area of plastic deformation in target material than the glass shots due to higher kinetic energy. Furthermore, increasing the shot velocity and size resulted in an increase in indentation. However, a negligible effect of the shot velocity, size, and material was observed on target's surface and subsurface residual stress. The obtained results demonstrated that the proposed FE models simulated the shot-peening process in a realistic way. The study can be used to determine and optimise the shot-peening parameters such as shot size, material and velocity, and amount indentation and residual stresses in the aluminium alloy plate.},

  abstract = {In existing simulations of the Almen intensity test, arc height is indirectly obtained by an equivalent method including a representative cell, a few shots and equivalent loading. Most of these equivalent methods cannot consider the transverse deformation of the strip, the complex stress state of the plastic hardening layer and process parameters, resulting in deviation from the actual test. This paper introduces an improved and experimentally validated discrete element model (DEM)-finite element model (FEM) to predict the actual Almen intensity. The improvement of this model is mainly reflected in the large and real number of shots involved in the actual Almen intensity test, shot\textendash shot interactions, and real-size solid finite element model of the Almen strip. A new method for calculating the shot stream is proposed based on the test and considering test process parameters such as the mass flowrate, nozzle movement speed and nozzle\textendash workpiece distance. The shot stream impacting the strip with a fully restrained underside was first simulated in improved DEM-FEM to bring the forming energy. As a second step, an implicit solver of the Almen strip FEM calculates the spring-back to simulate strip removal from the holder. The results achieved by the present approach are compared with the results obtained by the experimental results and those in the literature. The results show that the arc height and Almen intensity obtained by the present approach match much better with the literature than the traditional method. Some new results obtained by the improved coupling DEM-FEM method are presented. The influences of the transverse deformation and surface plastic layer on the deformation of the Almen strip are discussed. This improved method provides an alternative characterization method for precision peen forming simulation.},

At the same times it changes the surface topography which may have a deleterious effect on the contact fatigue life. A fully understanding on the mechanism of shot peening for high-strength steels is to be explored. In this paper, the effect of shot peening coverage on residual stress, surface roughness, microhardness and microstructure of rollers are experimentally investigated. Experimental results show that the shot peening leads to a slight increase of surface and near-surface hardness from 690~HV to 740~HV, and an appreciably increasing of the subsurface maximum compressive residual stress. Moreover, some retained austenite in the the near-surface layer are transformed to martensite after shot peening, and wherein the grain refinement occurs.},

  abstract = {Shot peening is becoming a widely used surface strengthening technique for various key mechanical components for its enhanced influence on the fatigue performance. This technique allows to strengthen the mechanical properties of material via introduce a certain depth of compressive stress layer and change the surface topography. The relation of the shot peening processing parameters, the surface integrity including residual stress and the surface roughness remains a large unmet practical need. In this paper, the residual stress and surface topography obtained by various shot peening treatments were experimentally and theoretically examined. A random multi-shots peening model of a carburized roller, accounting for the initial hardness gradient and residual stress was developed. The measured residual stress and surface roughness present good agreements with the predicted results. Both the experimental and simulated results reveal that the axial and tangential residual stress components tend to be consistent after shot peening. In addition, the influence of peening coverage on detailed evolution of surface topography and residual stress is investigated. It is found that the ratio between the layer thickness of compressive stress and the critical depth of maximum stress generally lies in the regime of 3.6\textendash 4.3 after shot peening. As the coverage increases from 100\% to 400\%, surface roughness parameters Sa, Sq, S5z, Sku decrease, while the maximum magnitude of compressive stress fluctuates in the range of 1105{$\sim$}1230 MPa. This work could act as an advisory reference for shot peening engineering practices.},

The program of ANSYS/LS-DYNA was utilized in the 3D finite element dynamic analysis of SP process, and the 3D homogeneous and inhomogeneous models were set up. The results showed that the compressive residual stresses (CRS) were introduced in the matrix, but the tensile residual stresses appeared in the reinforcements. The maximum CRS and tensile residual stress were -1511 and +1155MPa respectively, which revealed the higher yield strength of reinforcements. This type of stress distribution revealed the effect of reinforcements, keeping the adverse tensile stresses in the reinforcements and retarding the damage to the matrix during deformation. In terms of experiments, after SP, the residual stresses along the depth from the surface were measured using X-ray diffraction (XRD) method. The experimental results indicated that the CRS formed in the surface layer and the maximum appeared on the subsurface. The range of residual stresses found in experiments supported the simulated results, which verified the validity of 3D finite element dynamic analysis.},

The underlying motivation for this work was to predict coverage, compressive residual stress (CRS), and roughness of the alloy, Al 2024-T351. These characteristics were assessed by computational modelling that is based on a combined finite element method (FEM) and discrete element method (DEM). The advantage of this combined method is that we only need to combine a representative dimple with the impact locations obtained from different SP parameters in DEM. Especially in the parametric analysis was carried out to evaluate coverage regarding to SP parameters. Furthermore, the DEM simulation generates an input file for the FEM simulation, which is then used to analyse the CRS and the resulting roughness that corresponds to SP parameters. The numerical coverage study (based on the combined DEM-FEM method) exhibited the same trend as the experimental data, with respect to the percentage of full coverage time, t, and is more reliable than theoretical calculations. In a practical sense, the developed model has the ability to accurately achieve the desired surface with the ability to adjust the SP parameters efficiently.},
