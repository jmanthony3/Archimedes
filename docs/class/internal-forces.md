# internal-forces

The design of a structure or a mechanical member requires to know the loading acting within the member.

<dl>
<dt><strong>Internal Forces</strong></dt>
<dd>Forces acting within a plane when a body is "cut" across some section.</dd>
</dl>

Types of #internal-forces:
1. Normal forces attempt to elongate or compress the body with a force normal to the surface wherein the force acts. $\sum_{z} = 0$, $\int dN = \sigma dA \implies \sigma = \frac{F}{A}$
2. Shear forces acts in-plane to cause bodies to slide past each other. $\tau = \frac{V}{A} = \frac{T\rho}{J}$, where $\tau_{max} = \frac{Tr}{J}$ and $\tau_{rect} = \frac{VQ}{It}$, $Q = A'\bar{y}' \implies (\tau_{rect})_{max} = \frac{3V}{2A}$
3. Torsional moments or torques tend to twist the body aboust some axis perpendicular to the area. $T = \int \rho dF$, where if $\tau = \frac{dF}{dA} \rightarrow dF = \tau dA \implies T = \int\rho\tau d$
4. Bending moments tend to bend the body about an axis within some plane of area in the body. $\sigma_{flexure} = \frac{My}{I}$, where $\sigma_{max} = {Mc}{I}$

<dl>
<dt><strong>Stress</strong></dt>
<dd>The representative way in which force is distributed throughout a body.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Torque</strong></dt>
<dd>When twisted, the cross-section of a torqued body is assumed to remain plane and the angle of twist is rather small.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Bending</strong></dt>
<dd>Here, the cross-section, and consequent loadings, are symmetric.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Shear</strong></dt>
<dd>Generally thought to act independent of *bending*; although, this is not actually the case in many conditions. The distribution of this stress along a cross-section is *parabolic*.</dd>
