## Introductions
- This course will include failures of materials (sometimes desirous); although, this study can extend to other materials beyond solid mechanics
- Why study? Because solid bodies experience failure, which we can represent from an elastic equation.
- From a Creationeering perspective, if failure occurs in (6), (7), or (8) occurs to early, then we step back to (2) to reevaluate.
- We will become experts by the end of this course to analyze material failure.

### Prerequisites
Need to know stress-strain relationships.

### Textbooks
We do NOT need to buy these, as this course is entirely from Dr. H's collected knowledge.

### Group Activities
- 2 is a group. 5 is a team.
- We will choose a famous event to study & write a report of analysis and present the findings. This is for group projects.
- The Team Project, we will give the client (Dr. H) to analyze a supplied broken part.
- Of the 10 times Dr. H has taught, 5 have produced journal articles from these case studies.
- Dr. H will create these after Add/Drop.

### Goals and Objectives
- Each student will be able to explain common phenomenological failure events and synthesize an argument for why failure occurs using the proper application of the process.
- Financial costs of car accidents is equivalent to cancer/heart attacks; however, we spend on our money researching medical causes.

### Expectations
1. Be honest
2. Be neat
3. Be attentive
4. Be prepared
5. Be articulate
6. Be respectful
7. Be responsive
8. Be professional

- [Viscoplasticity](engr-743-001-damage-and-fracture/viscoplasticity.md): inconstant strain-rate $\rightarrow$ reverse loading of plastic region does not follow forward loading

## Adam and Julian Comments
- Titles are wordy or not?
  - If you can, use a picture.
  - Wordy is okay in the caption at the top.
  - The body of the slide should contain pictures before written information.
  - Years ago at Sandia National Labs (SNL): a protocol changed how he had done his first slide presentation for SNL from university style.
- Transfer of information lacked and showed how a basic strength of materials problem caused failure.
  - To resolve this, proact and document learned processes.
- The Holy Spirit does not pressure us into decisions. Allow yourself to think through a decision and pray through it.

## [Lesson 11: Ductile Fracture](engr-743-001-damage-and-fracture/lesson-11-ductile-fracture.md)

## Adriel and Micah Comments
- Never put citations at the end, because this violates SEC.
- What was the point of failure for the Hartford Civic Center? All of the above.
  - Design: chose cross instead of I-beams.
  - Analysis: incomplete with excluded members; the engineers even said that doubled deflection was acceptable.
  - Procurement: built the roof on the ground and not in-place, which placed residual stresses at connection points.
    - Distortions are inherent to construction.
    - They are removed, either by constrained deflections, which imbues residual stresses that creates a mean stress: halving the fatigue life.
- A tolerance study could have shown likelihood and locations of failure within design: if a range of tolerances are known, then if an issue arises during Procurement, Assembly, and Service Life, its impact could be determined as catastrophic or mild.
- A designer must design for the Procurement, Assembly, Service Life, Sustainability, and Death/Life Cycling.
- Design for normal AND abnormal environments; because customers look at normal environments, but we want them to be able to handle abnormal environments as well.
- There is rarely only one point of failure: it usually dominos from one to another.
- The problem was in the systems approach: not any single point or component.
  - Objectives
  - Constraints
  - Variables

## Quiz 3 Recap
1. False: Theoretical strength from the electron count and lattice structure, which is different for each material; therefore, the theoretical is greater than the real strength, but different for each material.
2. Only for brittle materials and elastic behaviors.
3. It depends on your definition; $\therefore$, ask what their definition is or give them. So define it each time this is discussed.
   1. Relationship of the $a$ and $b$.
   2. Not always clear, so define it.
4. Crack-tip blunting?
   1. Being sharp is a pre-condition, but does it cause it?
   2. Traction force outside the body matches internal forces in the direction of applied loading. Lack of extrinsic forces.
   3. (D), but any of them could be acceptable with declared logic.

_Oral or written final exam? Decide this later._

7. Failure mode?
   1. #crazing with #fatigue in polymer.
   2. asdf
   3. Mode-mixing.
8. Use yielding.
9. Any of them could be acceptable with presented logic.
10. Crack length, $a = 5 mm$.

## Final Presentations
### Rod Specimen Notes
MFH thinks we have a paper.

#### Chronology
- have backup ideas for the order of failure events. 
- What if it was not that order? Does the order matter?
- Assumption: there is an order. Working hypothesis: what we presented.
  - Cross-threading.
  - Uncertainty exists. But engineers work with the uncertainty.
- Up front declaration of mating surfaces not clear.
- On stress-strain curve:
  - Which was literature? And was that the O2 steel?
  - What material did the EDS say? What did the tensile test say? Do they agree?
  - Both materials work-harden; therefore, the yield would have been much higher than reported.
- What material is it?
- What is the effect of colder temperatures on the stress-strain curve? What bridged the ambient test to the cold service environment?
  - Ductile in tensile test.
  - Saw cleavage on fracture surface from cold conditions: brittle.
  - Beach marks indicate different loading conditions, but these could have happened later?
- Chronology
  - Slide 5 includes only 6 ksi tensile pressure.
  - Fatigue alone would not be driving mechanism, but data seems to indicate that fatigue happened first.
  - Use the torque equation to find mean stress and R-ratio for material, and use the material that the EDS indicates to compare altogether.
>**Nickel answer: fatigue, but need all the calculations. Likely the wrong material was sent, even though O2 steel was ordered. Overloading could be brittle or ductile fracture. Cleavage could have been related to temperature or a big particle/goody allow cleavage.** <cite> MFH
- Coalescence on Slide 14.
- Fatigue striations are leading and coalesce to beach marks from varying loading condition due to some transfer function of stress indictive of the geometry.
- Mating surfaces (Side A) seem to indicate shearing between the valley and hill. These could be cleaved surfaces.
- Do the shear lips from the tensile test look like the shearing planes on the fracture surface?
- Shearing could not have cleaved (referring to Slide 8).
- **Q: What are the particles on the highly polished surface (Slide 16)?** _A: Particles were noticeable as the mesoscale: likely dust from wiping the surface prior to placing in SEM._

### Pliers
#### Slides
3. Difficult to see (lighting), but it was heavily corrode from storage in/near chlorine.
4. The pliers themselves were largely unused: not a heavily serviced part.
5. Compression test attempted, but highly unreliable.
   1. Literature and chemical composition determined material later.
   2. Seemed to be iron with high percentage of carbon.
   3. Microstructures greatly change SS curve for graphitic iron.
6. Heat treatments evident, because of high hardness, which varied between handle and teeth.
   1. Handle seemed to be soft.
   2. Teeth were much harder: more heat treatment.
7. Kept in jar to separate from environment to better preserve surface.
8. Corrosion makes identifying direction of failure difficult.
9. Very dimply at $100 \mu m$. 
   1.  Particles were present as well.
10. Getting down to $10 \mu m$, very ductile, but also revealed cleaved surfaces with cracks.
11. More iron oxide corrosion, whether before or after chlorine.
12. asdf
13. Ductile fracture from pearlite iron?
14. Polished surface revealed highly ordered graphite matrix ($100 \mu m$).
    1.  EDS indicates cast iron.
    2.  Chemical etching would have indicate ferrite and pearlite phase, but not possible without etchant.
15. Comparing with literature, polished surface matches the compacted graphite iron percentage of pearlite/ferrite composition.
16. Modulus of elasticity was constant, but Brinell hardness shows wide variance: (100-250).
    1.  Reasonably without range of material of pearlite/ferrite composition.
    2.  Expect a lower percentage of nodularity, because of lower concentrations of pearlite.
17. Cleaved surfaces in the midst of dimply surface indicates (working hypothesis) that ductile fracture was coupled with local, particle shearing.
18. Ductile fracture still main mechanism driving to ultimate failure, but quasi-cleaved is a mixture of these and likely the local mechanism at particles. 
    1.  Common in hydrogen-enhanced steels, but could still apply to our heat-treated material.
    2.  Ductile fracture enhanced by hydrogen inclusions.
19. EDX revealed carbon contamination and heavy chlorination.
20. Percentages indicate much carbon (but likely contamination). Still great at local places of iron.
    1.  Pearlite grains did not reveal chlorine, but oxidation layers.
    2.  Depth of field inhibits data collection.
21. More oxidation on mating surface, but also likely more oxidation due to chlorine.
22. ABAQUS with half-plier.
    1.  Belief of cast metal may have stress concentrators due to geometry and attempt to defeature where necessary.
    2.  Grip strength is only an estimate.
    3.  An area of improvement would be BC's on half-plier.
23. Literature data for 25.8% pearlite and 16.6% nodularity. 
    1.  Belief of main iron matrix, with variability, is largely pearlite.
    2.  Validated with single-element.
24. Mesh refinement--with defeatures--indicated slight dependence on mesh count.
    1.  Could be due to imperfect defeatures.
    2.  Could also be mesh element type.
    3.  Concentration of higher element counts at areas of stress concentration: likely drove overall value up.
25. von Mises stress and max principal verify stress concentration in tension around handle.
26. Max principal strain, $\epsilon_{1} = 2\%$. Preliminary simulation with nominal grip strength could cause failure at stress concentration locations.
27. Future work would include physical testing to simulate service conditions.
28. Conclusions:
    1.  Material = compact graphite iron with pearlite grains.
    2.  Quasi-cleavage failure.
    3.  Significant corrosion potentially sped up failure.

#### Questions
- What about the flat plane? Casting.
- Why did this handle break and not the other? Slightly different thicknesses.
- MFH initially thought this the more difficult because of the corrosion, and liked the thought of hydrogen embrittlement. 
  - Probably a grade cast iron.
  - Most cast steels exhibit quasi-cleavage around hydrogen inclusions.
  - Liquid cools at different rates and forms oxides at the leading surface: these are incubation sites for hydrogen pores or shrinkage.
  - Testing for hydrogen embrittlement would be due buy one of these and putting in chlorine bath to collect hydrogen.
  - No marks on pliers make difficult to buy duplicate, also was MFH's granddad's. So very old. Likely, company does not exist anymore.
- ISV
  - Image-J to get data of ISV.
  - Former PhD student made constants, but did not collect hydrogen embrittlement. 
  - Could easily include in ISV modeling.
- ABAQUS simulation
  - Prelims showed that any man could break it, even without hydrogen embrittlement.
  - What is the thing that happened, not the 50 things that happened?
- River marks versus ABAQUS?
  - River marks did point to where FEA said it would fail.
  - But some marks contradicted.
  - ASM handbook may include images similar to these fracture surfaces.
- Why so much carbon content?
  - Carbon contamination.
  - Difficult to calibrate for smaller specimens.
  - Used carbon concentration to find locations of pearlite or nodularity.
- Hardness? Vickers.
  - 268-304 at handle.
  - 729-1169 at teeth.
  - Variability within bounds of cast iron, but for higher pearlite composition.
  - Most surfaces showed ferritic fracture, not pearlitic. But estimate without etching.
- von Mises versus max principal.
  - Max principal was reached first and at the 400 N load.
  - von Mises failed next, but at 320 N.
  - Indicates Mode I: tension.

### Overall comments
- Number slides.
- Titles should always make a statement of the final conclusion. What is the main point?
- Magnification is useless. What is the length scale?
- Spell check.
- Update these small things before sending in slides.
- Say the nickel answer first. This helps to track the logic through the analysis.

#### Comments
- Jared:
  - Appreciated the confidence to make an engineering decision and move, despite the great uncertainty in data. Good demonstration to show ability to make an assumption, move on, and see where it led.
  - **Q: What concluded to hydrogen embrittlement?** _A: Found that hydrogen embrittlement was common to quasi-cleaved surfaces._

## Final Exam Discussion
Relating to the final: MFH will ask the same 10 questions of everyone and we all have 30 min to answer.

Will make a Word doc of questions and we can all write into that.

Questions on Exam:
1. What are the 12 Steps?
2. Does adding creep shorten fatigue life? 
   1. Fatigue cracks incubate at persistent shear bands. These can initiate creep cracks.
   2. Fatigue has three levels incubation, short crack, long crack and creep has three levels. So the interaction between these levels between the two mechanisms reveals their relation.
