### Zeiss #SEM Demonstration
- Of the three softwares, never choose #in-situ* unless you know that you need it. Click on either of the others and create an account if you do not already have one.
- The most import settings are in the **SEM controls** tab!
- Probably do not need $300 \mu m$ #aperture-size.
- Do not mess with extractor values. Leave the gun voltage between $15-20 kV$.
- If your sample charges and you do not want the beam to sit there for too longer, you can use frame averaging when scanning and viewing the sample.
- Images and work should be saved to the `D:` drive.
- Metadata saved to the images include absolutely everything that was set to capture that image: aperture, voltage, etcetera.
- Increasing the voltage on the "InlensDuo Grid" will reject more low energy #BSE.
- "InlensDuo" detector is not super great at low mag.

## X-Ray Spectroscopy
This begins Chapter 6, but may overlap with X-Ray detection from Chapter 2.
This chapter focuses primarily on how X-rays are produced.

### [Lecture 12: X-Ray Generation](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/lecture-12-x-ray-generation.md)

Wednesday, we will see how to run this software on the Zeiss.

!!! note Talking about the exam
    Generally conceptual with a handful of equations wherein you may be asked to explain what will happen in the microscope if one parameter is varied.
    Joked about listing a bunch of acronyms and matching their definitions.

!!! tldr #SEM versus #TEM
    The #TEM source is from the below and through the specimen.

### [Lecture 15: TEM Imaging Modes](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/lecture-15-tem-imaging-modes.md)

!!! todo Project 2
    Develop a plan of work and discuss it next week.

    The Monday (10/24) following the Continuum exam will be the Mid-Term whereupon Project 1 is also due.

!!! info Mechanical Testing in Project 1
    No tension/compression testing required for Project 1.
    Only do (micro)hardness testing.
    If other mechanical testing is desired for Project 2, see Dr. Atwater for other direction.

*Lecture (19): October 17, 2022*

!!! attention Mid-Term
    This lecture marks the beginning of content for examination after the Mid-Term: i.e. lectures before this will be on the Mid-Term.

## X-Ray Diffraction
### [Lecture 18: XRD Equipment and Setup](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/lecture-18-xrd-equipment-and-setup.md)

!!! attention 10/26
    - Project 1 due by midnight.

## Review
!!! attention Mid-Term
    Open whatever out at CERE @ 9:30.

Some of the more important keywords will be #field-diaphragm (thing with the hole in the middle) and #aperture-diaphragm (the hole in the middle of the thing) because they affect magnification.
If you close the diaphragm, this limits the amount of light coming into lens; whereas, aperture can reduce stray electrons near the beam axis for better [contrast](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/contrast.md).
Go back to [Lecture 4: Microscope Design](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/lecture-4-light-microscope-design.md) for diaphragm effects and compare to [SAD](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/selected-area-diffraction.md) for [Lecture 16: TEM Diffraction Patterns](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/lecture-16-tem-diffraction-patterns.md#selected-area-diffraction-sad).
For example, topography is more noticeable in [darkfield](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/darkfield.md) because you can see more off-axis light by reducing light in the axis of the #electron-beam.
Each spot in the [diffraction pattern](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/lecture-16-tem-diffraction-patterns.md) is the collection of energies from certain #crystallographic-planes.
Each dot gives information about the #crystal-structure and the spacing for crystal size.

!!! question What are two ways to improve [resolution](../engr-743-001-damage-and-fracture/resolution.md)? <cite> #Mark-Atwater
    Increase wavelength, reduce aperture, or change the light source intensity.

There will also be questions of application from Project 1: such as reducing charging in the #SEM, what [sputter coating](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/sputter-coating.md) does, or what sample prep would be required to look at some #fracture-surface.

!!! question How would you increase signal in #SEM? <cite> #Mark-Atwater
    More voltage for more backscatter.
    More grid bias on [Everhart Thornley detector](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/everhart-thornley-detector.md).
    Adjust working distance closer to or tilt toward sample.

!!! question Why more #SE on a sphere surface? <cite> #Mark-Atwater
    Low energy and attracted to a grid over opposite where the electron exits which appears to add shading to the topography, whereas the signal intensity will be rather low.
    Edges may appear bright for this reason (or could be charging) because more electrons exit from the exposed surface not normal to the viewing angle.
    Bright spots are typically from #EBSD from higher Z-number elements.

Some acronyms to expect:
- #EDS: Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy
- #EBSD: Electron Backscatter Diffraction
- #FESM: Field Electron Scanning Microscopy
- #WDS: Wave Dispersive Spectroscopy
- #XRF: X-ray Fluorescence
- #NaCl: Sodium chloride

Questions will likely take some time if you do not immediately know the material.
#Mark-Atwater would rather us know how to use the equipment and what it can do without reinventing the theory of what the machine uses.

!!! question What is the [interaction volume](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/interaction-volume.md)? <cite> #Mark-Atwater
    Shaped like a tear-drop of the volume below the surface where each type electron interacts with the beam from the #electron-beam.
