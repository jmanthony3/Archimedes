### Zeiss #SEM Demonstration
- Of the three softwares, never choose *in-situ* unless you know that you need it. Click on either of the others and create an account if you do not already have one.
- The most import settings are in the **SEM controls** tab!
- Probably do not need $300 \mu m$ aperture size.
- Do not mess with extractor values. Leave the gun voltage between $15-20 kV$.
- If your sample charges and you do not want the beam to sit there for too longer, you can use frame averaging when scanning and viewing the sample.
- Images and work should be saved to the `D:` drive.
- Metadata saved to the images include absolutely everything that was set to capture that image: aperture, voltage, etcetera.
- Increasing the voltage on the "InlensDuo Grid" will reject more low energy BSE.
- "InlensDuo" detector is not super great at low mag.

*Lecture (13): September 26, 2022*
## X-Ray Spectroscopy
This begins Chapter 6, but may overlap with X-Ray detection from Chapter 2.
This chapter focuses primarily on how X-rays are produced.

### [X-Ray Generation](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/x-ray-generation.md)

Wednesday, we will see how to run this software on the Zeiss.

*Lecture (14): September 28, 2022*
### [Equipment and Techniques](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/equipment-and-techniques.md)
!!! note Talking about the exam
    Generally conceptual with a handful of equations wherein you may be asked to explain what will happen in the microscope if one parameter is varied.
    Joked about listing a bunch of acronyms and matching their definitions.

*Lecture (15): October 03, 2022*
## Transmission Electron Microscopy
### [Equipment and Techniques](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/equipment-and-techniques-tem.md)


---


*Lecture (16): October 05, 2022*

!!! tldr #SEM versus #TEM
    The #TEM source is from the below and through the specimen.

### [Imaging Modes](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/imaging-modes.md)

!!! todo Project 2
    Develop a plan of work and discuss it next week.

### [Defect Imaging](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/defect-imaging.md)
!!! attention Mid-Term and Project 1
    The Monday (10/24) following the Continuum exam will be the Mid-Term whereupon Project 1 is also due.

!!! info Mechanical Testing in Project 1
    No tension/compression testing required for Project 1.
    Only do (micro)hardness testing.
    If other mechanical testing is desired for Project 2, see Dr. Atwater for other direction.

*Lecture (19): October 17, 2022*

!!! attention Mid-Term
    This lecture marks the beginning of content for examination after the Mid-Term: i.e. lectures before this will be on the Mid-Term.

## X-Ray Diffraction
### [Equipment and Setup](equipment-engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/equipment-and-setup-xrd.md)

!!! attention 10/26
    - Project 1 due by midnight.
    - Mid-Term this day at CERE at 9:30 in (50 min).

*Lecture (21): October 24, 2022*
## Review
!!! attention Mid-Term
    Open whatever out at CERE @ 9:30.

Some of the more important keywords will be field diaphragm (thing with the hole in the middle) and aperture (the hole in the middle of the thing) because they affect magnification.
If you close the diaphragm, this limits the amount of light coming into lens; whereas, aperture can reduce stray electrons near the beam axis for better contrast.
Go back to [Lecture 4: Microscope Design](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/light-microscope-design.md) for diaphragm effects and compare to SAD for [Lecture 16: TEM Diffraction Patterns](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/diffraction-patterns.md#selected-area-diffraction-sad).
For example, topography is more noticeable in darkfield because you can see more off-axis light by reducing light in the axis of the electron beam.
Each spot in the diffraction pattern is the collection of energies from certain crystallographic planes.
Each dot gives information about the crystal structure and the spacing for crystal size.

!!! question What are two ways to improve resolution? <cite> Dr. Atwater
    Increase wavelength, reduce aperture, or change the light source intensity.

There will also be questions of application from Project 1: such as reducing charging in the SEM, what sputter coating does, or what sample prep would be required to look at some fracture surface.

!!! question How would you increase signal in SEM? <cite> Dr. Atwater
    More voltage for more backscatter.
    More grid bias on Everhart Thornley detector.
    Adjust working distance closer to or tilt toward sample.

!!! question Why more secondary electrons on a sphere surface? <cite> Dr. Atwater
    Low energy and attracted to a grid over opposite where the electron exits which appears to add shading to the topography, whereas the signal intensity will be rather low.
    Edges may appear bright for this reason (or could be charging) because more electrons exit from the exposed surface not normal to the viewing angle.
    Bright spots are typically from EBSD from higher Z-number elements.

EDS: energy dispresive spectroscopy
EBSD: electron backscatter diffraction
FESM: field electron scanning microscopy
WDS: wave dispersive spectroscopy
XRF: 
NACL: Sodium chloride

Questions will likely take some time if you do not immediately know the material.
Dr. Atwater would rather us know how to use the equipment and what it can do without reinventing the theory of what the machine uses.

!!! question What is the interaction volume? <cite> Dr. Atwater
    Shaped like a tear-drop of the volume below the surface where each type electron interacts with the beam from the electron beam.
