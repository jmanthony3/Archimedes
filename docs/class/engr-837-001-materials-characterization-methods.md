### Zeiss #SEM Demonstration
- Of the three softwares, never choose #in-situ* unless you know that you need it. Click on either of the others and create an account if you do not already have one.
- The most import settings are in the **SEM controls** tab!
- Probably do not need $300 \mu m$ #aperture-size.
- Do not mess with extractor values. Leave the gun voltage between $15-20 kV$.
- If your sample charges and you do not want the beam to sit there for too longer, you can use frame averaging when scanning and viewing the sample.
- Images and work should be saved to the `D:` drive.
- Metadata saved to the images include absolutely everything that was set to capture that image: aperture, voltage, etcetera.
- Increasing the voltage on the "InlensDuo Grid" will reject more low energy #BSE.
- "InlensDuo" detector is not super great at low mag.

*Lecture (21): October 24, 2022*

**Review**

!!! attention Mid-Term
    Open whatever out at CERE @ 9:30.

Some of the more important keywords will be #field-diaphragm (thing with the hole in the middle) and #aperture-diaphragm (the hole in the middle of the thing) because they affect magnification.
If you close the diaphragm, this limits the amount of light coming into lens; whereas, aperture can reduce stray electrons near the beam axis for better [contrast](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/contrast.md).
Go back to [Lecture 4: Microscope Design](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/lecture-4-light-microscope-design.md) for diaphragm effects and compare to [SAD](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/selected-area-diffraction.md) for [Lecture 16: TEM Diffraction Patterns](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/lecture-16-tem-diffraction-patterns.md#selected-area-diffraction-sad).
For example, topography is more noticeable in [darkfield](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/darkfield.md) because you can see more off-axis light by reducing light in the axis of the #electron-beam.
#diffraction-spots in the #diffraction-pattern is the collection of energies from certain #crystallographic-planes.
Each dot gives information about the #crystal-structure and the spacing for crystal size.

!!! question What are two ways to improve [resolution](../engr-743-001-damage-and-fracture/resolution.md)? <cite> #Mark-Atwater
    Increase wavelength, reduce aperture, or change the light source intensity.

There will also be questions of application from Project 1: such as reducing charging in the #SEM, what [sputter coating](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/sputter-coating.md) does, or what sample prep would be required to look at some #fracture-surface.

!!! question How would you increase signal in #SEM? <cite> #Mark-Atwater
    More voltage for more backscatter.
    More grid bias on [Everhart Thornley detector](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/everhart-thornley-detector.md).
    Adjust working distance closer to or tilt toward sample.

!!! question Why more #SE on a sphere surface? <cite> #Mark-Atwater
    Low energy and attracted to a grid over opposite where the electron exits which appears to add shading to the topography, whereas the signal intensity will be rather low.
    Edges may appear bright for this reason (or could be charging) because more electrons exit from the exposed surface not normal to the viewing angle.
    Bright spots are typically from #EBSD from higher Z-number elements.

Some acronyms to expect:
- #EDS: Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy
- #EBSD: Electron Backscatter Diffraction
- #FESM: Field Electron Scanning Microscopy
- #WDS: Wave Dispersive Spectroscopy
- #XRF: X-ray Fluorescence
- #NaCl: Sodium chloride

Questions will likely take some time if you do not immediately know the material.
#Mark-Atwater would rather us know how to use the equipment and what it can do without reinventing the theory of what the machine uses.

!!! question What is the [interaction volume](engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/interaction-volume.md)? <cite> #Mark-Atwater
    Shaped like a tear-drop of the volume below the surface where each type electron interacts with the beam from the #electron-beam.

*Lecture (24): November 07, 2022*

!!! summary Looking at the Mid-Term
    - The CLSM question was a bonus question.
    - WWJD was just a joke question and worth no points.
    - Chromatic is wavelength difference and spherical is lens imperfections.
    - NA is how much light the lens can detect.
    - Biological samples suffer from hydration (dehydrate) and low conductivity (sputter coat).
    - Electron concentration per angle is brightness is SEM.
    - Why cold-FEG less stable? Gas molecules deposit on the tip and reduce electric field efficiency.
    - VPSEM gas helps to react with excess electrons in material to ionize gas.
    - SE, BSE, and characteristic x-rays.
    - Topo: SE; BSE; X-rays
    - Multi Composition: BSE; X-rays; SE (as long as SE was last)
    - Single Composition: X-rays; BSE; SE (as long as X-rays were first)
    - z-numbers could be different.
    - Edges are brighter because the interaction volume extends outside the material.
    - TEM is difficult to prepare electron transparent section from 3mm disks.
    - ...

    The biggest issues Dr. Atwater saw was questions left unanswered.

    Answer the following questions:
      - What are you characterizing?
      - How is it used/why does it matter?
      - what is the information you expect to get?
      - What strategies are you using and how are they appropriate?
      - Your results and discussion.
      - What other strategies could you have used if we had the equipment? Be specific how you would apply them and what information you would gain (describe at least two).
