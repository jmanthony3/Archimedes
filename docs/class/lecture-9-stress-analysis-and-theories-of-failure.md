# Lecture 9: Stress Analysis and Theories of Failure
Before Dr. Lugo gets into ANSYS, he wants to give a very brief overview of what it is engineers do.
Not all students in this class have a mechanical engineering background; therefore, this brief overview will set the stage of concepts applied in ANSYS.

**Engineers design solutions and structures to satisfy some requirements and conditions.**
It is the engineer's responsibility that every part and component of that solution is suitable and necessary to help the overall structure accomplish the task.
Does every part withstand the internal stresses; can the part be simplified or optimized; is the part necessary?

## Internal Forces
We must analyze element by element the forces internal to the structure and the components.
