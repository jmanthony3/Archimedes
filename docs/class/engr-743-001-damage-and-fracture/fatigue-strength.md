# Fatigue Strength

The point at which #fracture occurs after specified number of cycles. Not necessarily [fatigue limit](fatigue-limit.md).
1. Fatigue life is how many cycles.
2. The termination of the curve is where the specimen will break, period.
3. Same shape for [HCF](high-cycle-fatigue.md), which is low amplitude, or the converse for [LCF](low-cycle-fatigue.md).
