# 12 Steps to Forensic Materials Engineering

0. Do Nothing! _Observe_
1. Collect background information
   1. Service history: need to know everything
   2. Any abnormal conditions
   3. Begin to compile photo record
   4. Any missing parts? 
2. Preliminary visual examination and record keeping
   1. Low magnification or no mag photos
   2. Observation skills are crucial: is there...
      1. Chemical attack
      2. Mechanical damage
      3. Excessive deformation
      4. No gross deformation
      5. Cracking patterns
   3. #boundary-conditions
3. Non-destructive evaluation
   1. Stress analysis
   2. X-ray (radiography)
   3. Ultrasound: Best way to get materials [Young's Modulus](youngs-modulus.md)
   4. Magnetic particle: Best way to find crack or #void-growth
   5. Liquid penetrant
4. Mechanical testing
   1. Are standards up to spec? #ASTM, #ASME, etcetera
   2. How is it loaded? Tensile, hardness, etcetera
5. Selection/Preservation of fracture surfaces
   1. Avoid cleaning and touching
   2. **DO NOT PUT MATING PIECES BACK TOGETHER!!!**
   3. Beware of heat generated by cutting
6. Macroscopic examination
   1. #optical-microscopy
   2. Look for deformations
   3. Crack directions
   4. #texture
7. Look for local #failure-modes: Smaller features
   1. #fatigue-striations
   2. #inclusions
8. Metallography
   1. Cut and polish
   2. Show #grain-growth and heat treatment
   3. Correct etchants are critical
   4. Take samples from various areas
   5. Is the material microstructure correct?
   6. Is bad heat treatment, wrong material?
9.  Determine #failure-mechanisms
    1. #ductile-fracture
    2. [brittle fracture](brittle-fracture.md)
    3. #wear
    4. [fatigue](fatigue.md)
    5. Cant it be re-located?
10. Chemical analysis
    1. What material do we have?
    2. Use #SEM for x-ray scattering
11. Mechanical failure analysis
    1. Back-of-envelope calculations
    2. Look for #notches and [stress concentrations](stress-concentration.md)
12. Test under simulation service conditions
    1. Useful, but time and money act against you
    2. Be careful to accurately simulate situation
13. Final analysis and report
    1. Your audience is typically a lawyer, which will criticize everything you do.
