# Lesson 11: Ductile Fracture

2. [Brittle vs. Ductile Fracture](brittle-versus-ductile-fracture.md)
- Ductile - extensive plastic deformation and energy absorption (toughness) before fracture
- Brittle materials - little plastic deformation and low energy absorption before fracture
- The difference between these: "It depends."
  - _Always ask what it means to the person speaking._
  - Definitions can mean different things to different people. _Dr. H's story of stress for materials scientist, physicist, and solid mechanics guy._

3. [Brittle vs. Ductile Fracture](brittle-versus-ductile-fracture.md)
- Things usually become more brittle the colder they are (A36 is an exception: common structural steel).

4. [Ductile Fracture (Dislocation Mediated)](ductile-fracture.md)
- Necking requires [void nucleation or coalescence](void-nucleation-coalescence-and-growth.md) to occur; therefore, [necking](necking.md) does not always occur before #failure.
- #Mark-F-Horstemeyer's continuum model can capture all this

## Why is a temperature increase showing failure strain in opposite directions for ductile metals?
Also see the note for [void nucleation, coalescence, and growth](void-nucleation-coalescence-and-growth.md)
- Suggested working hypothesis:
  - #nucleation decreases in elevated temperatures and #coalescence increases
  - Inverse for lower temperatures
- #failure is not "#ductile-brittle-fracture" dominated, but #nucleation - #coalescence.
  - Left coalesced faster at higher temperature.
  - Right nucleated faster at lower temperatures.
  - #strain-rate and temperature are inversely related and inverse effects.
  - If *#coalescence*- increases with increased temperature, then it inversely decreases if #strain-rate increases; therefore, greater elongation at failure.
  - *#nucleation*- increases at lower temperatures, but if #strain-rate also decreases, then nucleation will decrease.

!!! question (T/F) When strain-rate increases in [ductile fracture](ductile-fracture.md), does void nucleation or void coalescence dominate?
    It depends.

>"If you understand this paradigm, you have solved the general behavior of all materials." <cite> #Mark-F-Horstemeyer

>"There is no material that violates this _law_: the inverse relation of temperature and #strain-rate." <cite> #Mark-F-Horstemeyer (from #Daniel-Kenney's question if this held for _odd_ materials: #A36-steel becoming harder at elevated temperatures)

- Q: >"Does #void-growth not affect #damage?" <cite> #Jared-Darius
- A: It is involved, but not dominating.

!!! question Does #void-growth not affect #damage? <cite> #Jared-Darius
    It is involved, but not dominating.

!!! question If the infinite radius notch simplifies to uniaxial loading, where the gradient of triaxiality > 0.66, is this why #void-nucleation occurs at the center and not the edges? <cite> 
    YES!
