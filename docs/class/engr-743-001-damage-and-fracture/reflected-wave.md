# Reflected Wave

Reflection of wave back up from specimen into the striking body: such as striking portion of a #Hoppy-Bar from specimen.
The reflected wave is opposite of the sense of the [incident wave](incident-wave.md) upon a #free-surface.
- Not as simple as the difference of the front and back of a wave.
- The reflected wave is very sensitive to the time domain.
- Also extremely sensitive to material geometry.
