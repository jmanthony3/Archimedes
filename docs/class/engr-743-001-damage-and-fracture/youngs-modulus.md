# Young's Modulus

...is stiffness in tension/compression.

!!! question Is Young's Modulus based on loading or unloading of a material?? <cite> #Mark-F-Horstemeyer
    - Compliance in machines may cause errors in material response.
    - Therefore, unloading is more characteristic because it is the material in itself.
    - The machine causes much more damage in the material than the deformities within the material when loaded.
    - We define plastic deformation as the amount of to which the material comes to within in its $\epsilon$-domain. Elastic strain can recover in the material, but it is not at 0. Think of plastic as thermodynamic #entropy. Some mechanical losses go to temperature.
