# Stress Rupture

1. Ultimate failure is #fracture, even though stress is constant, because strain is increasing.
2. #transgranular / #intergranular depends on temperature and #strain-rate: lower creep rates and temperatures.
3. #brittle
   1. Usually #intergranular.
   2. Initiates at #triple-points of grains
   3. No elongation of grains (even after visible plasticity).
4. #ductile
   1. #transgranular
   2. Initiated at #intergranular cracks.
   3. Elongated grains.
5. Irregular and discontinuous fracture surfaces.
