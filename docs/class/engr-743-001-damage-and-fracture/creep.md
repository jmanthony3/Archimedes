# Creep

Time-dependent strain under constant stress.
1. Primary: imperfections align. Dominated by #nucleation.
2. Secondary: #equilibrium #work-hardening.
3. Tertiary: cracking override, #work-hardening. Dominated by #coalescence.

Not all stages may occur. Though all stages include #nucleation and #coalescence. Unified-Creep Plasticity (#UCP): #ISV -damage for plasticity maps to the stages of creep.

## Tests
Creep tests can be stress (see [Ratcheting](ratcheting.md)) or strain controlled. **Strain-controlled is a relaxation test.** Dynamic ( #glide ) and static ( #climb ) recovery in #ISV hardening. Creep plays a role into every test, but people misuse the term in their tests.
