# Fatigue Limit

Stress does not change for infinite cycles.
1. Dislocations affect the local yielding which will cause failure locally.
2. Companies will define these fatigue limits for marketing purposes.
3. **The limit at which the material can cycle forever.**
4. It can be right, if:
   1. Single crystal of monolithic material with no defects.
   2. But they are so small, difficult to test.
   3. Real engineering includes all the phases of dislocations.
   4. This, then, becomes a design limit.
