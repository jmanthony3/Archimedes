# Spallation

#crack-nucleation into #fracture from new #free-surface at the back side of the material, because the high compression in a small area gets reflected into tension to create these #notch-root-radius.
Occurs on the reflecting #free-surface because of the sharp change in compression to tension tears the material off.
Is not an example of momentum; instead *think back to a particle in an ocean wave*.
