# Void Nucleation, Coalescence, and Growth

#void-nucleation occurs more rapidly in the cold.
#void-coalescence dominates in higher temperatures.
For single void, it is independent of temperature.
More #voids allows for more #void-coalescence, which dominates at a higher rate than nucleation growth for single #voids.



## Why is a temperature increase showing failure strain in opposite directions for ductile metals?
- Suggested working hypothesis:
  - #void-ucleation decreases in elevated temperatures and #void-coalescence increases
  - Inverse for lower temperatures
- #failure is not "#ductile-brittle-fracture" dominated, but nucleation-coalescence.
  - Left coalesced faster at higher temperature.
  - Right nucleated faster at lower temperatures.
  - Strain-rate and temperature are inversely related and inverse effects.

**T/F when #strain-rate increases in #ductile-fracture, does #void-nucleation or #void-coalescence dominate?*- _It depends._

  - If *#void-coalescence*- increases with increased temperature, then it inversely decreases if #strain-rate increases; therefore, greater elongation at failure.
  - *#void-nucleation*- increases at lower temperatures, but if #strain-rate also decreases, then #void-nucleation will decrease.

!!! question Does #void-growth not affect #damage? <cite> #Jared-Darius
    It is involved, but not dominating.
