# Atomistic Simulations

## Polyethylene
- Crystalline structure and amorphous.
- Uniaxial tension.
- Poisson's effect visible.

## Car Crash
- Stress wave triggers airbags. 
- Stress wave moves faster than the material can respond: before the human can move into the steering wheel.

## Genesis Flood

- Belief that Yucatan meteor caused Genesis Flood.
- Is possible.

## Ram's Horn
- Compression wave gets reflected to tension and moves to shear, before wiggling out at the end of the horns.
- Wiggles out in a manner similar to Fibonacci sequence.
- Same for bison horns or woodpecker's tongue.
- Just changing cross-sectional area dissipates to shear. Adding curvature does this even faster.
- Pressure wave onto the brain creates tri-axial tension: **Super bad**.
- Stiffer material--bone--keeps the faster pressure wave contained to the stiffer material to give softer, squishier tissue time to respond to the wave.
