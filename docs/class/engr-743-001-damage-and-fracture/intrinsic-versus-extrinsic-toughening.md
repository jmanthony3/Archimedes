# Intrinsic versus Extrinsic Toughening

Resistance of a material within the material to #deformation.
1. [Intrinsic](intrinsic-toughening.md): before crack (internal to the material)
2. [Extrinsic](extrinsic-toughening.md): after (behind) the crack
3. Also includes *#grain-bridging*
    1. Frictional effects (#dissipative but into the #crack-tip). All energy transfer.
    2. #oxides are good examples of [extrinsic](extrinsic-toughening.md): does formations of #oxides on a reactive metal help to impede or increase #crack-growth?
        1. _It depends_ on the #ductile material.
        2. If an already #brittle material, no, because it will not yield much anyway.
        3. If a #ductile material, it may help impede the #crack-growth.
    3. Anything that impedes the #crack-propagation at the #crack-tip, this reduces the #crack-driving-force (can limit the #crack-tip from opening the material).
4. Crack closure:
    1. elastic regime and opening things up
    2. Where is the plastic regime, near the #dislocations.
    3. #stress-strain-curve: material goes back with "#back-stress" ( #kinematic-hardening ) if in plastic regime.
    4. This #back-stress will resist the #crack-wake from opening.
    5. Affected by the direction of #dislocations.
5. #plastic-zone around #crack-tip is _[intrinsic toughening](intrinsic-toughening.md)_.
    1. Seen by misaligned grains / #dislocations
    2. Difference between #long-crack and #microstructure-crack is the length scale: [critical crack length](critical-crack-length.md).
6. San Andreas fault--super #long-crack --driven by tectonic plate movement, driven by the mantle, driven by convection currents, created by the Genesis flood.
