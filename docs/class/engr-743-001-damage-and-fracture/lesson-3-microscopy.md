# Lesson 3: Microscopy

- Material Microstructure Characterization Techniques
  - #optical-microscopy (OM)
    - This will be used for Final Project
  - Scanning Electron Microscope ( #SEM )
    - We are getting one
    - Will also be using for Final Project
    - Polish before scanning
  - Transmission Electron Microscope ( #TEM )
    - Do not have one...yet
    - Polish before scanning
  - #Atomic-Force-Microscope (AFM)
    - Also trying to get
  - **[Confocal Microscopy](../engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/confocal-microscopy.md)**
    - More like an #optical-microscopy
  - Before destroying something, look at it to know what broke
    - X-rays or #optical-microscopy
    - **DO NOT PUT BROKEN PIECES BACK TOGETHER!!!**
      - This ruins the #fracture-surface
- [Depth of Field](depth-of-field.md)
- [Resolution](resolution.md)]
- Light v Electron Microscope
  - #optical-microscopy
    - Put a scale bar in images
    - Denoting the scale "100X" is NOT helpful to the reader
    - 100X is only helpful to the guy doing the study; however, it can be included during discussion of the experimentation process
    - You want to find a representative volume element: an element that represents a typical volume of space within specimen
      - May not be first "picture" you take
      - May need to stitch pieces together
      - Bio-materials are really difficult to get good resolution
    - [The Effect of Etching](../engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/sample-preparation.md#etching)
      - Chemical process to enhance certain features of a material
  - Electron Microscope
    - Essentially x-rays being transmitted toward material
    - X-rays help identify a particular section of material as specific chemical elements, because of detection of the number of electrons
    - No one believes the analysis, except the analyst
      - Because he followed the #Scientific-Method
    - Everyone believes the experiment, except the experimentalist
      - He can see all the errors
  - #SEM
    - Start with the largest length scale and incrementally zoom in
    - This instantly creates publication worthy images
    - This is the point: to write a journal article of the findings
    - Casting #pores --point inclusions --are initiators of damage
      - Hydrogen does not allow metal to bond to other things, because it cools too quickly
    - > "#twinning is a change in the #crystal-lattice structure to accommodate deformation from loading. But it acts as a #grain-boundary." <cite> #Daniel-Kenney
    - #magnesium is like swiss cheese, because the front interacts with oxygen first, which is very reactive
      - $MgS_{2}$- #magnesium sulfide--solid precipitates from this process
  - #TEM
    - Can get into the $\text{\AA}$ length scale of a material
    - Primarily worried about #oxides in steels
      - Forms an #inhibition-layer
      - Use zinc to prevent rusting
      - The #inhibition-layer can be $<2 nm$ thin, which will affect the structural integrity of the whole steel part.
      - Can also depict "texture" which is the crystal lattice structure

!!! question Is materials processing a deterministic, cause-and-effect world or statistical? <cite> 
    - #Albert-Einstein said cause-effect
    - #Neils-Bohr said statistical
    - #Mark-F-Horstemeyer says it is both

    Materials processing changes structures to produce mechanical properties.
    History of the material--through its materials processing--is important to know, because point of #failure is statistically determined from the current point
