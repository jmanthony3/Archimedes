# Lesson 22: Even More Fatigue

2. [fatigue](fatigue.md) failures
   1. Different length scales give different evidence of #failure
3. #microscale can show [striations](striations.md) in #grains themselves
4. #initiation includes: [incubation](incubation.md), #microstructure-crack, and #crack-tip-displacement and its #crack-wake
   1. For each defect type, there is a different #incubation-rate
5. [fatigue](fatigue.md) in salt water at $90 MPa < 210 MPa$
   1. Focus is a casting #pores (smooth surfaces) with #hydrogen-shrinkage (labyrinth of black dots around casting #pores) around it
   2. #Ken-Gall want to see [incubation](incubation.md)
   3. Looks like the Cooper picture from before, but with #magnesium
   4. This picture showed why energy transfer was not sufficient ( #Mark-F-Horstemeyer, #Dave-McDowell, and #Ken-Gall )
      1. #energy-dissipation happens at #free-surface (Thermo II)
      2. Therefore, some energy went into #cracks that #crack-arrested or #crack-branched
      3. Use geometry methods: *#strain-life*
6. Different location, same specimen
   1. #persistent-slip-bands (PSB) within #grains along #twinning-planes, coupled with #hydrogen-shrinkage
   2. #crack-nucleation from interaction of #persistent-slip-bands
7. Within the #grains:
   1. More #persistent-slip-bands with more cycles
   2. Eventually, #cracks in the #grains from the #persistent-slip-bands
8. #cracks from #persistent-slip-bands starts aligning with the #cracks in the #grains site
   1.  Ultimately #crack-coalescence together
   2.  #cracks starts earlier for the #persistent-slip-bands with a stress field in front of it
9.  [Multi-Site Fatigue](lesson-19-multi-stage-fatigue-msf.md)
    1.  All these sites are [incubating (babies born)](incubation.md)
    2.  Then #coalescence together.
10. White spots are [intermetallics](intermetallic.md) (very #brittle)
    1.  [Stress corrosion cracking](stress-corrosion-cracking.md)
    2.  No #corrosion-pits, because the #oxide-layers are #nanoscale (difficult to see)
11. #magnesium more susceptible to [corrosion](../engr-839-001-mechanical-metallurgy/corrosion.md) than #Al
    1.  #fracture follows the straining from forging
    2.  #river-marks in the #crack-wake
12. [Stress corrosion cracking](stress-corrosion-cracking.md) grounded AC-130's in the 70's
    1.  Fixed by rewinging
    2.  Or bonding
13. Mothballed in '78 by CIA
14. '88: Interior Department buys them: named N-130's
    1.  One crashed in '02
    2.  Amazing it lasted
15. NTSB investigated
    1.  Original design intent: clearly different
    2.  Engineering support
    3.  Know the nominal and abnormal boundary conditions.
    4.  Inspection intervals?
16. Unsafe condition identified likely to exist on other Lockheed C-130's
    1.  Exchange in '88 for museum quality aircraft
    2.  Illegal exchange
    3.  '99 indictments
    4.  C-130's still fly today...
17. USAF Aging problem
    1.  An increase of fleet increases maintenance costs
18. Bonded repairs ('70s)
    1.  Solution to drill a hole in front of #crack-tip
    2.  Radius is low around #crack-tip counteracted by the larger #notch-root-radius of the hole
    3.  Maybe swiss cheese is not a good idea
    4.  Bonding...
19. Load spectrum for the C-130
    1.  Unknown service life
    2.  #crack-growth is unpredictable
20. Follow the [12 Step Method](12-steps-to-forensic-materials-engineering.md)
    1.  Take pictures and label them
    2.  Can move them to another place to reconstruct the accident
21. #stress-intensity factor
    1.  Reduce by gluing on a patch to disperse load by taking some strain from the hole.
    2.  Thermal and traction stresses.
    3.  Tapered to reduces secondary bending and minimize [shear bands](shear-band.md)
22. [Damage tolerance](damage-tolerance.md) guidelines
    1.  critical #cracks cannot be fixed: do not fly the plane
    2.  If no #failure at ultimate load, then conservative.
    3.  Better than drilling holes, but what is the efficiency, thermal transfer, how long is it effective, etcetera?
23. Efficiency: Riveted joints to minimize strain along bonding path
24. Repair smaller #cracks, because their #crack-growth-rate is less.
    1.  Still allows for #damage 
25. Tested two full-scale planes
    1.  One patched
    2.  One unpatched
    3.  Showed patching increased #fatigue-life with equal, random vibration sessions applied to either specimen
26. -34 Inspection interval halves while crack grows
    1.  #cracks follows unpatched trend, but is displaced after each patch.
    2.  Minimizes the slope of the #crack-growth-rate over service life.
    3.  If optimally designed, then planes would #failure later, but all fail in the same way.
    4.  _Redundancy_
27. What should have been done?
    1.  Could never have been flown again.
    2.  Or permanently repaired.

[fatigue](fatigue.md) is obviously a problem, but the Air Force is moving to adopt the #damage.

!!! question Why not replace parts in place? <cite> 
    AM parts hospital to print parts in place.
    But too much #porosity reduces strength compared to wrought/forged materials.
    All coupled with thermal/mechanical with chemistry for #diffusion / solidification processes.
