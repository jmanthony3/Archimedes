# Lesson 24: Failure of Engineering Materials

2. Effect of Overloads
   1. [Striations](striations.md), because of 2 microns length scale.
   2. Transition in size of [striations](striations.md), because the loading condition changed.
   3. Smaller [striations](striations.md) implicates smaller loads.
   4. _Ask Stephen if SEM images are publication worthy._
3. #fractography to understand #fatigue history.
   1. Gouges at radial edges.
   2. #river-marks in center point to failure point.
   3. #beach-mark: tougher metals make bigger [striations](striations.md).
   4. What are the types of loads, stress levels, cycles?



## Case Study: Failed C-130 Wheel Flange
- Service life of 20 yrs.
- Inspected each time tire changed with no visible cracks prior to failure.
5. Complex structure of flange. #stress-concentration everywhere.
6. [Striations](striations.md).
7. #ductile-fracture voids.
   1. debond in #monotonic-overload and crack #incubation there.
   2. #fatigue-striations present, but the last half-cycle might be ductile.
   3. It is not the whole story.



## Howitzer Gun:
- Tough steel and contained enriched uranium.
- $\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$ to make high-speed, heavy rods.
- #hardness-test to see if material is sufficient for its service conditions.
- A2 tool steel used everywhere: and a manufacture said the hardness was Rc 56.
  - The student found 55-57.
  - Therefore, material was sufficient, and now they had a data sheet.
- Hardness is within spec, and the highest stress was below yield.
- #FEA showed 220, but failure would be 270: so no #damage.
- #SEM showed a lot of white stuff on cross-section; therefore, $t$ is much less and stress would be higher. But is that a manufacturing defect?
- _Conclusion: Material defect within manufactured part._
