# Lesson 21: More Fatigue

1.  #beach-marks tells you changes of environment, because loads shift around that #beach-marks. Not necessarily #fatigue-striations.
    1.  May certainly align with #fatigue-striations.
    2.  Number of #beach-marks indicates number of shifts
2.  #microscale ( [striations](striations.md) )
    1.  Number of [striations](striations.md) is the number of cycles.
    2.  [Incubation](incubation.md) and #damage-rate is the disparity between ( #Jares-Bernard, 2008) the number of cycles and number of [striations](striations.md).
    3.  #Jares-Bernard measured the $\frac{da}{dN}$ increment, which matched 1:1 with the #RepliSet-Method.
    4.  #Jim-Newman doesn't agree with [incubation](incubation.md), but concurred from #crack-growth after this particular image.
3.  [striations](striations.md) can #coalescence from two #nucleation sites, but only proven if #dimples in between.
