# Lesson 21: More Fatigue

1.  #beach-mark tells you changes of environment, because loads shift around that #beach-mark. Not necessarily #fatigue-striations.
    1.  May certainly align with #fatigue-striations.
    2.  Number of marks indicates number of shifts
2.  #microscale ( #striations )
    1.  Number of #striations is the number of cycles.
    2.  #incubation and #damage-rate is the disparity between (Jares Bernard, 2008) the number of cycles and number of striations.
    3.  Jares measured the $\frac{da}{dN}$ increment, which matched 1:1 with the Repliset method.
    4.  Jim Newman doesn't agree with #incubation, but concurred from #crack-growth after this particular image.
3.  #striations can coalesce from two nucleation sites, but only proven if #dimples in between.
