# Simple Shear

Simple shear ([torsion](../../../attachments/engr-743-001-damage-and-fracture/simple_versus_pure_shear.png)) produces a straining of the element, but the diagonal angle remains constant.
1. 2 faces of the element.
2. It does not look like it, but momentum is conserved.
3. This #Conservation-of-Momentum is #plastic-spin ( #continuum ).
