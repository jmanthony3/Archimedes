# Simple Shear

Simple shear ([torsion](../../../attachments/engr-743-001-damage-and-fracture/simple_versus_pure_shear.png)) produces a straining of the element, but the diagonal angle remains constant that is #Mode-II, in-plane shearing of #cracks.

!!! tip In-Plane Shear
    Think of #cracks having an (under/over)bite corrected.

1. 2 faces of the element.
2. It does not look like it, but #Conservation-of-Momentum which may not hold when looking at a single grain in tensor notation (Dr. Cho will check on this 220919).
3. This #Conservation-of-Momentum is #plastic-spin ( #continuum ).
