# Lesson 2: Multiscale Aspects of Materials

## What can cause material failure in product?
What | %
-|-
Improper Material Selection | 38
Fabrication Defects | 15
Faulty Heat Treatment | 15
Mechanical Design Failure | 11
Unforeseen Operating Conditions | 8
Inadequate Environmental Control | 6
Crack of Inspection/Quality Control | 5
Wrong Material | 2

## Microstructure and Property Relation
- To predict/avoid failure

## Structure
- Sub-atomic: electrons
- A

## Scale of Things
_insert image later_

## Atomic Scale
- Basic crystal structures

## Primary Structure
[Void Nucleation, Coalescence, and Growth](void-nucleation-coalescence-and-growth.md)
: Nucleation occurs more rapidly in the cold. Coalescence dominates in higher temperatures. For single void, it is independent of temperature. More voids allows for more coalescence, which dominates at a higher rate than nucleation growth for single voids.

## Project
- Team 2
  - Jaton
  - Micah
  - Joby
  - Jared
  - Sharisha
  - David Glenn
- We will be using material much the same size as what was in the box
- Present a journal article similar to that found in research 
- Refer to [Engineering Failure Analysis](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/engineering-failure-analysis)
