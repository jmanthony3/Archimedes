# Ratcheting

Increase of strain at constant stress.
1. Ford: #Dave-McDowell published a lot of ratcheting and reached out to #Mark-F-Horstemeyer being his student.
2. Is it stress or strain controlled?
   1. If strain, no ratcheting, because the geometry constantly grows and volume space changes.
   2. If load controlled, then things could be added to the volume space: ratcheting.

| The top curve is an example of "ratcheting" because the stress is held constant through the test and strain is allowed to vary. |
