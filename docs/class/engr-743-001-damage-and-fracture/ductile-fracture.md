# Ductile Fracture

Extensive plastic deformation and #energy-absorption (toughness) before fracture.

- Extensive #plastic-deformation.
- Slow #crack-growth: "stable"
- Necking requires [void nucleation or coalescence](void-nucleation-coalescence-and-growth.md) to occur; therefore, #necking does not always occur before #failure.
- #Mark-F-Horstemeyer's continuum model can capture all this
- Voids and pores are synonymous in materials science, but "pores" are preferred because "void" usually refers to astronomical events.
- Cup-Cone interaction forces pore growth in the dead center, and a shear band at $45^{\circ}$ in uni-axial loading. 
  - Stress state divided by von Mises.
  - Tensile pressure applies here, which applies uni-axially in this particular scenario.
- Like in medicine, some definitions are labelled differently depending on the scenario and observer.
- Today, we are bridging the materials science and physics, because the #constitutive physics are the same.
