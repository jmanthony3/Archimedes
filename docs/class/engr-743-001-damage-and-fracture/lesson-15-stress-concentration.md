# Lesson 15: Stress Concentration

3. #failure-modes
   1. Historical Perspective
      1. #fracture of molasses tank in Boston 1919.
      2. 2 million gallons.
      3. 12 dead, 40 injured, many horses shot.
      4. Litigation.
      5. Much technical disagreement on cause.
   2. Why do some structures #fracture when others yield?
      1. Material selection.
      2. Overall load situation.
      3. Details.
4. [Stress Concentrations](stress-concentration.md)
5. [Stress concentration (cont'd)](stress-concentration.md)
6. [The stress concentration factor, $K_{t}$](stress-concentration.md)


12. Designing to minimize #notch-root-radius
13. #stress-intensity factor, $K_{I}$
    1.  Background
    2.  Griffith: F-111 Wing Pivot Fitting
14. Case Study
    1.  #river-marks at the #dimples point to the location of #failure.
    2.  [fatigue](fatigue.md) shows #beach-striations at the #microstructure level.
    3.  However, #river-marks at the naked eye points to the #initiation point.
15. [Damage Tolerance Concept](damage-tolerance.md)
    1.  All materials have flaws, so we'll live with it.
    2.  Largest flaw is just smaller than you can detect.
    3.  Inspection intervals set by smallest detectable flaw and #crack-growth-rate expected based on flight loading
16. What this mean for #failure-analysis?
    1.  #brittle or mostly [elastic](elasticity.md) materials
17. #ductile materials
    1.  #failure-stress goes down, because it would have been elastic.
        1.  #notch-root-radius facilitates #void-growth (triaxiality).
        2.  Locally increases stress.
    2.  Yield stress can go up ( #notch-root-strengthening ).
        1.  When is "yield"? GM says failure, Ford says elastic yield.
    3.  In practice, #notches are always bad since #fatigue-life always worsens with #notches.
