# Lesson 18: Fatigue

1. U.S. Air Force's Aircraft Structural Integrity Program
   1. Presented at the 9th International Fatigue Congress.
2. Background
   1. "To ensure the design level of structural safety, performance, durability, and supportability with the least possible economic burden throughout an aircrafts design service life.
   2. Objectives:
      1. Maximize safety.
      2. Minimize costs.
3. Applicability
   1. 3 Components
4. Definitions
   1. Structure: any component that performs a structural function and includes wings, landing gear, engine, and weapon mounts, etcetera
      1. Excludes engines, avionics, hydraulics, crew system, fuel system, etcetera.
   2. Integrity: the condition that exists when a structure is sound and unimpaired in providing the desired level of safety, performance, durability, and supportability.

!!! info Tangent: Post-Doc's Granddad
    - Gets shot down over Siberia in WWII.
    - Jumps out the plane, but his parachute doesn't deploy.
    - Lands perfectly in a deep, deep pool of snow.
      - Snow sinters.
      - Heats
    - The German who shot him down, saw him, and reported him.

1. History
   1. 1958:
      1. Multiple planes lost in flight.
      2. All had <2,500 flight hours per craft.
      3. Cause:
         1. **#fatigue**- failures of critical wing, fuselage, and wing-to-fuselage attach structures
         2. Ramification

_Formulations of #fatigue from trains did not extend to planes and cars for 50 years._

   2. 1969
       1. F-111 lost over Nevada
       2. ~107 hours of flight time
       3. Cause:
          1. **#fatigue**- failure of a critical wing pivot fitting
6. Safe Life and [Damage Tolerance](damage-tolerance.md)
   1. Safe-Life
      1. Assumed initially flawless material
      2. End-of-service: #crack-initiation
   2. [Damage Tolerance](damage-tolerance.md)
      1. Assumed some flaw size
      2. End-of-service: Fatigue Life cut in half
      3. Inspections are periodic and required.
      4. US Air Force, post-'69
7. Objectives
   1. Definitions for each 
8. Task Process
   1. Design
   2. Analyze
   3. Full-Scale Testing
   4. Certification
   5. Force Management Execution
9. Fatigue Testing
   1. Starting in '69 fatigue took off
   2. #FEA began to gain ground
10. Risk Analysis
    1. Quantify benefits
    2. Quantify risks
    3. They are exclusive to each other.
    4. Quantify the probability of them occurring.
    5. Then make a decision.
11. New Aerial Systems
    1. Composites were always thought as the answer.
    2. Cost is high and hard to quantify benefits.
