# Wave Speed

$\omega_{s} = \sqrt{\frac{E}{\rho}}$

- The wave moves through the material faster than it can strain.

!!! hint
    Think of ocean currents moving underneath waves at the surface.

- The time domain affects the rate of energy domains through the material.

!!! question Is the strain of the material its response to keep #Conservation-of-Momentum? <cite> 
    It depends. The time step is very significant.
    Any dislocation is the material #dissipating energy.
    So modeling assumes piecewise-linear between time points and thermodynamic equilibrium.
