# Lesson 4: Mechanics of Materials

- #analytical-solution uses rough guess approximations, because there are uncertainties
  - Analytical
  - #FEA
- Mechanical Properties
  - How do materials respond?
    - #stress-strain
      - Tension
      - Compression
      - Shear
      - Torsion
    - Elastic/Plastic Deformation
      - Yield Strength
      - Tensile Strength
      - Ductility
      - Toughness
      - Hardness
- #stress-strain
  - Simple geometries allow for analytical solutions
  - Complex geometries require more complex solutions: #FEA
- Types of Loading
  - Tension
  - Compression
  - Shear
    - [Simple](simple-shear.md): only two faces in shear
    - [Pure](pure-shear.md): all four faces are in shear
  - Torsion
- Questions
  - _What is relative measure of how much force a material experiences?_ **Stress**
  - _What is the relative measure of how much deformation a material experiences?_ **Strain**
- Concepts of #stress-strain
  - $\sigma = \frac{F}{A_{0}}$ 
    - $A_{0}$: original area of material **(aka [engineering](../engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/engineering-stress.md))**
    - $A$: instantaneous area of material **(aka [true](../engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/true-stress.md))**
  - $\epsilon = \frac{\Delta l}{l_{0}}$
    - Change in length divided by original length
    - Ratio/Percentage of deformation
  - _Why is rock best in compression?_ Its structure is very complex and #anisotropic.
  - _Why does a rockfish explode when it surface?_ Its internal equilibrium is in tension in all 3 directions, which is the worst loading case.
- Concepts of Shear and Torsion
  - $\tau = \frac{F}{A_{0}}$
  - $\gamma = tan(\theta)$
- _Is [Young's Modulus](youngs-modulus.md) based on loading or unloading of a material?_
  - Compliance in machines may cause errors in material response.
  - Therefore, unloading is more characteristic because it is the material is itself.
  - The machine causes much more damage in the material than the deformities within the material when loaded
  - We define plastic deformation as the amount of to which the material comes to within in its $\epsilon$-domain. Elastic strain can recover in the material, but it is not at 0.
    - Think of plastic as thermodynamic entropy. Some mechanical losses go to temperature.
    - **QUIZ QUESTION**
- #stress-strain Behavior
  - Yield stress is a definition. **Know this definition.**
  - #ISV uses proportional limits. Handbooks use 0.2% offset.
  - $\sigma = E\epsilon$ 
    - [Moment of Inertia, $I = bh^{3}$](moment-of-inertia.md): Stiffness in bending
    - [Young's Modulus](youngs-modulus.md) is stiffness in tension/compression
    - Yielding could be because of geometry
  - Plastic Deformation
    - #stress-strain is no longer proportional
    - Deformation is no longer reversible
    - [Poisson's ratio](../engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/poissons-ratio.md) shows proportion of change in cross-sectional area for some change in length in the direction of loading.
      - Tension: #necking occurs
      - Compression: barreling occurs
      - [Shear bands](shear-bands.md)
- **Modeling is done in true stress-strain**
