# Lesson 32: Creep Fatigue

1. There are levels to creep under constant stress, but what if fatigue is included?
   1. High temperature and cyclic loadings from turning blades.
   2. Constant thermal loads.
2. Fatigue life shorter in higher temperatures. 3 levels of creep happen within the plastic zone ahead of crack.
   1. Primary is nucleation. Tertiary is dominated by coalescence. This is not to say that the other levels do not include nucleation or coalescence. 
   2. Creep equals plasticity.
   3. Stress and environment are important. Thermal thresholds delineate when something will creep or won't creep. But want to observe smaller variations. These variations may include creep, but does this need another mathematical model to handle the different failure mechanisms.
   4. What are the creep rates? Are they independent of the fatigue cycling?
3. Fatigue crack growth with juxtaposition of holding the stress or strain constant. Is strain=-constant creep? It is stress-relaxation to measure the stress.
   1. The first thought to hearing creep fatigue is: They held stress constant.
   2. Always ask their definition.
   3. Ratcheting present by increase of strain at constant stress.
      1. Ford: Dave McDowell published a lot of ratcheting and reached out to MFH being his student.
      2. Is it stress or strain controlled? 
         1. If strain, no ratcheting, because the geometry constantly grows and volume space changes. 
      3. If load controlled, then things could be added to the volume space: ratcheting.
   4. Creep plays a role into every test, but people misuse the term in their tests.

4. History with J-integral to find energy related plasticity in some zone. Creep and plasticity are the same thing. 
   1. The depicted C-star is similar to the J-integral by making an energy argument at the fatigue crack tip.
   2. This has difficulty with multiple failure sites.

5. Time to rupture comparisons could indicate which mechanism dominates based on number of cycles.
   1. We can add, multiply, exponentiate, or hyperbolic.
   2. This early concept is simply adding. Like adding to damage to corrosion.
   3. If they do interact, multiplicatives and exponentials happen between the hyperbolic interaction. If independent, they add together.
6. Interaction mechanisms can affect each other at any level of creep, because of increased dislocation density by fatigue.
   1. If creep is added to ductile material, does this enhance or shorten the fatigue life?
   2. Adding dislocations harden and prevent crack growth. But persistent shear bands make the grow faster, because of crack initiation serving as incubation sites at the surface.
   3. Fatigue cracks incubate at persistent shear bands. These can initiate creep cracks.
   4. Fatigue has three levels incubation, short crack, long crack and creep has three levels. So the interaction between these levels between the two mechanisms reveals their relation.
   5. Bones exhibit this, because porosity increases with age.
7. High temperature shortens fatigue and tensile strength.
   1. Complex interactions from stress triaxiality.
   2. **Silly putty: creep (coalescence?) dominates, but if made cold enough, fatigue (nucleation?) dominates. YES!!!!!!**
   3. Typically transgranular.
   4. Extrinsic products include corrosion, because of adverse affects from hydrogen in environment.
8. "Hot-tear"--interesting--is similar to casting.
   1. If liquid: hot and larger volume.
   2. Solid: volume shrinks and tears around oxides.
   3. Dependent on humidity, because it leaves in shrinkage to nucleate these cracks.
   4. This could be how the tectonic plates formed between Day 3 of Creation and The Flood: nucleating cracks and then tearing open from some event (meteor or else).

10. Some interaction exists between creep and corrosion.
    1.  What happens in mechanics?
    2.  What happens in materials?
    3.  We are bridging these together.
11. Hot corrosion
    1.  Ceramic hip replacement with high resistance to corrosion.
    2.  Titanium has polyethylene coating, but can have bio-degradation.
    3.  This ceramic uses steel to coat the chromium/cobalt center, which hopefully does not crack.
    4.  Why not titanium? Maybe mating or just not explored yet.
    5.  Corrodes faster when hotter from accelerated chemistry.
12. Liquid metal embrittlement, but not popular.
13. Can fill cracks other materials and can drive crack growth in temperature change.
    1.  Competition between COTE and Young's Modulus.
    2.  This induces shear stresses at boundary or interface of dissimilar metals: alloys included at all length scales.
    3.  Previously, we called this galvanic corrosion, but there, temperature was constant.
14. Thermal fatigue and mechanical fatigue overlap. They dominate the rate of dislocation motion differently.
    1.  Wrought with fracture and failure.
    2.  Fracture Group: Sanford in Pittsburg.
        1.  1700: forces.
        2.  1800: stresses.
        3.  1920's: energy.
            1.  Irwin equation (1923).
