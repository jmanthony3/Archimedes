# Stress-Corrosion Cracking

Not fully understood yet.
1. #crack-incubation from combined influences of tensile stress and [corrosion](../engr-839-001-mechanical-metallurgy/corrosion.md) environment.
2. Impact between dry cracking and [fatigue](fatigue.md) threshold.
3. No #corrosion-pits, because the #oxide-layers are #nanoscale (difficult to see)
