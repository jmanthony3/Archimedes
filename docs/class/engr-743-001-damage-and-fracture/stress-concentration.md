# Stress Concentration

$K_{t}$

1. When a "perfect" solid is loaded in tension, the normal stress is the same in any part of the specimen.
2. If a flaw exists inside the specimen, then the free surface cannot transmit any load.
3. The material adjacent to the crack must carry the load.
4. The stress is **concentrated**.
5. Bending: $\sigma_{nom} = \frac{Md}{I}$.
   1. $\sigma_{max} = K_{t}(\frac{Md}{I})$.
   2. $K_{t}$ is the geometric stress concentration factor on the normal stress.
6. Shear: $\tau_{nom}$
   1. $\tau_{max} = K_{ts}\tau_{nom}$.
   2. $K_{ts}$ is the geometric stress concentration factor on the shear stress.
7. **Unitless!**
8. Inglis showed the state of stress of a plate with an elliptical hole to be: $$\sigma_{max} = \sigma_{gross}(1 + \frac{2a}{b})$$
   2. When $a$ increases, $\sigma_{max}$ increases. More crack like.
   3. If $b$ increases, $K_{t}$ decreases to $1$. More void like.
   4. If $a = b$, $K_{t} = 3$.
9. cont...
   1. Radius of curvature, $\rho = \frac{b^{2}}{a}$.
   2. This can be combined to show, $\sigma_{max} = \sigma_{gross}(1 + 2\sqrt{1 + \frac{a}{\rho}})$,
   3. where $K_{t} = (1 + 2\sqrt{1 + \frac{a}{\rho}})$



## Typical Stress Concentrations

$\frac{a}{b}$ | $K_{t}$
-|-
$\frac{1}{1}$ | 3.0
$\frac{1}{4}$ | 1.5
$\frac{4}{1}$ | 9.0
$\frac{10}{1}$ | 21
$\frac{100}{1}$ | 201



## Hole
1. Discontinuities of cross-section may result in high localized or _concentrated_ stresses.
2. $K = \frac{\sigma_{max}}{\sigma_{avg}}$
3. $\sigma_{avg}$ is that internal stress reacting to the remote force. 
4. $\sigma_{max}$ is an increase of $\sigma_{avg}$ when a void is included within the cross-section, because there is less area to apply the internal stress load over and the increase of radius of curvature.



## Fillet
1. Notch roots of fillets
2. $K_{t}$ is only geometry dependent, not the boundary conditions.
