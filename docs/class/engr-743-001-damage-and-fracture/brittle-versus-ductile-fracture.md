# Brittle versus Ductile Fracture

Brittle vs. Ductile Fracture
- [Ductile Fracture](ductile-fracture.md) - extensive plastic deformation and energy absorption (toughness) before fracture
- [Brittle Fracture](brittle-fracture.md) - little plastic deformation and low energy absorption before fracture
- The difference between these: "It depends."
  - _Always ask what it means to the person speaking._
  - Definitions can mean different things to different people. _Dr. H's story of stress for materials scientist, physicist, and solid mechanics guy._
- Things usually become more brittle the colder they are (A36 is an exception: common structural steel).
