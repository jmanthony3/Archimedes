# Thermionic Source

Thermionic sources heat a filament to high temperature to "boil" off electrons.
The lowest cost version is a tungsten wire.
A lanthanum hexaboride ($LaxB_{6}$) emitter has a lower #work-function (less than half that of $W$).
$LaB_{6}$ has a higher brightness (10X) and longer lifetime (10X) but high cost (10X).
$LaB_{6}$ also requires higher vacuum and that raises the complexity and cost of the microscope.
