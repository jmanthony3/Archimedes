# Rayleigh Criterion for Resolution

Two points are just resolved when the center of the Airy disk generated by one point coincides with the first zero of the Airy disk generated by the second point: $R = \frac{d}{2} \approx \frac{0.61\lambda}{\mu\sin(\alpha)}$.
$d$ is the Airy disk diameter (central spot); $\mu$ is the refractive index of medium between object and lens; $\alpha$ is the half-angle cone of light entering objective; and $\lambda$ is wavelength of light.
