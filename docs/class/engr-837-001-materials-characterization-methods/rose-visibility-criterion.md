# Rose Visibility Criterion

...states that the signal must be fives times greater than the noise to distinguish objects.
The deviation can be determined from the square root of the mean of n counts of S: $\Delta S > 5N$ or $\Delta S > 5\sqrt{\bar{n}}$.
[Contrast](contrast.md) was defined as: $C = \frac{\Delta S}{S} > \frac{5\sqrt{\bar{n}}}{S} = \frac{5\sqrt{\bar{n}}}{\bar{n}}$ which yields $\bar{n} > (5/C)^{2}$.
