# Numerical Aperture

The numerical aperture ( #NA ) is the gathering ability of the lens and related to the angle acceptance of incoming light: $NA = \mu\sin(\alpha)$.
Resolution is wavelength dependent, with visible light having a 400nm minimum.
For better resolution, oil immersion (n=1.5) can be used.
Why? A: the oil keeps the diffraction down at the boundary of the lens.
What is the maximum resolution of light? at alpha = 1, which would be within the lens itself.
Typically, #NA = 1.5 at blue light.
M=1000 is the limit of what your human eye can see in an optical microscope.
Any better magnification is better for computer analysis.
