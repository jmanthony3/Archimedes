# Light Microscope Design

**Objectives**

- discuss the design and operation of light microscopes
- identify key components and layout
- detail the light path and critical illumination points

***Microscopy Components***

Components of optical microscope include:

- illumination
- objective lens
- eyepiece
- camera
- specimen stage

***Illumination Source***

The illumination can vary in type and the characteristic wavelength it emits (color, temperature) and the total brightness. (The light source can be very hot, so do not put a cover on a microscopy too quickly!) The choice of illumination source is important as lens may be optimized for chromatic aberrations in that spectrum range or for the excitation of fluorophores. LEW sources can be tuned for a specific wavelength, which is especially useful in flourophore excitation.

***Illumination***

Consists of a collector lens and condenser lens (Koehler system). Collector lens focuses the light at the front focal plane of the condenser lens. Condenser lens focuses light at the sample. Defocuses the filament image at the sample for even illumination.

| Light that is diverging from the focal plane and incident to the lens, the exiting light is collimated which is perfectly defocused but is helpful to provide light onto the specimen. |

***Conjugate Focal Planes***

In the Koehler system, the same light path has two sets of conjugate focal planes: aperture planes are field planes. The aperture planes are for illumination (filament image). Light rays focused at the focal plane of the condenser are parallel after it. The field planes are for specimen image formation.

| These two paths are in the same light source and path. These are not two different ways to diagram or map the light rays: this is the same system from the specimen. |

Note: Think of the pinhole effect looking through a pinhole in a piece of paper by limiting the off-axis light.

***Koehler diaphragms***

The #field-diaphragm is placed at the focal plane for image formation rays and determines the illumination area.

|:--:|
| This diaphragm can be seen in the image when sufficiently closed. Restricts scattering light for improved image quality |

The #aperture-diaphragm is placed at the focal plane for illuminating rays and determines alpha (and thereby resolution and Df). The aperture diaphragm cannot be seen in the image plane.

***Reflected light (epi-illumination) and filters***

Reflected light microscope rely on a beam splitter to transmit light through the objective lens and back to the eyepiece or camera. Light filters can be placed in the light path to regulate intensity or color compensation.

***Objective lens***

most important to image magnification and quality. NA between 0.16-1.4.

Highest dy lens NA ~0.95.

Provide chromatic aberration correction:

- Achromat (good)
- Semi-achromat (fluorite) (better)
- Apochromat (best)

***Aberration Correction Types***

Achromat provide red and blue correction: must be illuminated green for black and white photography (old timey stuff). Semi-achromat has higher NA and better resolution, including some spherical aberration correction. Apochromat lenses have better spherical aberration correction, higher NA, much more complex design.

***lens identification***

***Eyepiece***

| ![](../../attachments/engr-837-001-materials-characterization-methods/eyepiece_220830_155535_EST.png) |
|:--:|
| Provides magnification multiplier. May further correct aberrations. May provide a graticule for measurements of features. May incorporate independent focal adjustment (parfocal) to correspond to a separate camera. May include diopter adjustment. |

***optimizing resolution***
- Use an objective lens with the highest NA possible
- use high magnification
- use an eyepiece compatible with the chosen objective lens
- use the shortest possible wavelength light
- keep the light system properly centered
- use oil immersion lenses if available
- adjust the field diaphragm for maximum contrast and the aperture diaphragm
- for maximum resolution and contrast
- adjust brightness for best resolution

***optimize depth of field***
- reduce Na by closing the aperture diaphragm or use an objective lens with lower NA
- lower the magnification for a given NA
- use a high-powered eyepiece with a low-power, high-NA objective lens
- use the longest possible wavelength light

***Summary***

light microscopes use a complex arrangement so f lens to get quality images.
the lens quality is critical, but the design and adjustment of the microscope must be correct to get the performance from those lenses.
problem illumination and defocused is achieved with the field and aperture diaphragms.
