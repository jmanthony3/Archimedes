# Contrast

Contrast
: The ability to discern features on a distinction of feature boundaries.

The contrast is the difference in light intensity between an object and its background.
Visibility requires a contrast threshold, and depends on brightness: bright light, contrast can be as as 3%; dim light, contrast must be as much as 200% or more.
Contrast is developed by varying signal, but the cause of signal variation can be from two primary sources:
1. Topography
2. Composition

## Mass-density contrast
The number of electrons being deflected by nuclei will increase as the thickness and density of the sample increases.
The local changes in either feature will result in changes in signal/brightness.
The objective aperture determines the maximum angle of deflection allowed to pass (0.01 rad).
The overall intensity is reduced for a smaller aperture, but the contrast is enhanced.
This is the main mechanism for imaging amorphous materials, such as polymers and biological samples: heavy metal stains can be used to further enhance contrast.

## Diffraction contrast
In crystalline samples, the electrons can undergo [Bragg diffraction](bragg-diffraction.md).
The planes with the crystal can be focused to a series of spots corresponding to the #crystal-structure (based on [Bragg diffraction](bragg-diffraction.md)).
The #diffraction-pattern (DP) is characteristic of crystal type and the lattice spacings.
