# Contrast

Contrast
: The ability to discern features on a distinction of feature boundaries.

The contrast is the difference in light intensity between an object and its background.
Visibility requires a contrast threshold, and depends on brightness: bright light, contrast can be as as 3%; dim light, contrast must be as much as 200% or more.
Contrast is developed by varying signal, but the cause of signal variation can be from two primary sources:
1. Topography
2. Composition
