# Topographical Contrast

## Trajectory
The #SEM produces images that appear 3D because the #SE signal is dependent on topography.
Surfaces oriented toward the detector will appear brighter because the signal is uninhibited from reaching it.
On the opposite side of a feature the #SE are absorbed in the material and signal is lost.

## Number
There are also signal intensity differences caused by the number effect which occurs where more electrons are emitted from the sample.
This can be in angled surfaces, at edges, and in thin sections.
Both #BSE and #SE are subject to this: #SE are more useful for topographical contrast.
