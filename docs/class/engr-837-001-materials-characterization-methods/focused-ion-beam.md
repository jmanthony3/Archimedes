# Focused Ion Beam

- FIB is a generalized description where ions are produced, focused, and rastered across a sample in a manner similar to electrons
- The ions can be used to produce and image or to remove material: typically, one cannot be achieved without the other
- The ion source is often a liquid metal ( typically #Ga ) and has to be replaced with use (1000s of hrs)
- The majority of FIB are part of a dual beam system, that also has an electron column for imaging

!!! note Melting Point of #Ga
    $\approx 30\degree C$; therefore, could melt in your hand and re-solidify when you drop it.

!!! warning Imaging
    When you image with ions, you risk damaging the sample.
    Ions are typically reserved for cutting.

## Source
#Ga must be heated to make it liquid.
The liquid #Ga wets a needle.
The #Ga is extracted from the needle using a high voltage.

## Column
The column design and focusing are similar to electron system.
The ions are accelerated and focused based on their positive charge.
Electrostatic lenses are used instead of magnetic: they must be very strong (high-voltage) to focus heavy ions.
