# Wavelength Dispersion Spectrometry

[WDS](wavelength-dispersion-spectrometry.md) provides better resolution than #EDS, but the setup is more complicated and costly.
[WDS](wavelength-dispersion-spectrometry.md) can detect changes in wavelength of $0.002-0.02$ ($0.01-0.1 keV$), which is an order of magnitude smaller than #EDS.
Element detection is from C (Z = 6) and above.
Element detection is sequential by scanning through a range of angles.
