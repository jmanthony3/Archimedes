# Resolution
## Objectives
- Consider the practical performance metrics and limits to light microscopy
- Determine how resolution is defined and what factors control it
- Discuss the factors influence image quality ([brightness](brightness.md) and [contrast](contrast.md))
- Identify source of image distortion (aberrations) and their importance

## Light diffraction
Light passing through an aperture will be diffracted.
The interference pattern created will produce an Airy disk through a round opening.
The distribution of light intensity will result a broadening of a point and unavoidable overlap between nearby points.

## Resolution limit
Resolution
: The smallest distance between two points at which they are both distinctly visible.

The Airy disks should not severely overlap, or the two points will appear as one.
The [Rayleigh Criterion](rayleigh-criterion-for-resolution.md) states that two points are just resolved when the center of the Airy disk generated by one point coincides with the first zero of the Airy disk generated by the second point: $R = \frac{d}{2} \approx \frac{0.61\lambda}{\mu\sin(\alpha)}$.
$d$ is the Airy disk diameter (central spot); $\mu$ is the refractive index of medium between object and lens; $\alpha$ is the half-angle cone of light entering objective; and $\lambda$ is wavelength of light.

## [Numerical aperture](numerical-aperture.md)

## [Brightness](brightness.md)

## [Contrast](contrast.md)

## [Depth of field](depth-of-field.md)

## Depth of field and depth of focus
One way to increase [depth of field](depth-of-field.md) is to decrease alpha.
This simultaneous reduces the resolution.
Features of a significant z-height may benefit from increased $D_{f}$ but only if large enough to sufficiently resolve.
The [depth of field](depth-of-field.md) is the distance from the lens to the object, and the [depth of focus](depth-of-focus.md) is the range of positions at which the detector or eye sees the object as in focus at a single object position ($M^{2}$ times larger than $D_{f}$).

## [Aberrations](aberrations.md)

## Field of view aberrations
Chromatic aberrations occur because the wavelength of light determine show the light refracts: shorter wavelength refract more strongly (high refractive index).
Spherical aberrations is caused by the lens curvature, where the off-axis rays are focused differently than the near axis rays.

## Off-axis aberrations
Astigmatism is caused by light rays being focused differently when passing through the horizontal axis versus the vertical axis: caused by lens asymmetry, a circle will appear elliptical.
Curvature of field occurs when a focal plane is not planar, but concave (if the detector is planar).

## Summary
- Light microscopy is versatile and capable, but the use of visible light has real limitations
- Getting an image and getting a good image are very different
- The sources of error are linked to fundamental physical principals and imperfections in design and manufacture
- Knowing the sources of error can help in determine proper use of the optical microscope
