# Bragg Diffraction

Crystal structure determined the way electrons (and later, x-rays) are diffracted.
The crystal type and planar spacing will dictate the pattern formed when the #electron-beam reflects from that structure.

| The #Bragg-angle is the incidence angle where the electrons are constructively reflected: $n\lambda = 2d\sin(\theta)$. |
