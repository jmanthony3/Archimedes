# Field Emission Sources

Field emission gun ( #FEG ) #SEM use a strong electrostatic field to draw electrons off the tip of the emitter.
A tip that is not heated is considered a #cold-FEG and requires an extremely sharp tip.
#Schottky-FEG uses lower temperature heating that [thermionic sources](thermionic-source.md) and a $ZrO$ coating to reduce the #work-function of a #single-crystal $W$ emitter.
#cold-FEG produce the best resolution, but #Schottky-FEG tips provide greater analytical capability and stability: #cold-FEG require extremely high vacuum and may need to be "flashed" to remove surface contamination.
