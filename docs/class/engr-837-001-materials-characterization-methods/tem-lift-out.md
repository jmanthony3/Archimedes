# TEM Lift Out

#TEM requires a thin ($100 nm$ or less) sample to be created.
This can be done from a surface by trenching out each side and then undercutting to create a sort of bridge.
That section is then attached to microneedle and the remaining attachments are released.
The microneedle is raised and a #TEM grid is brought in place.
The sample is then mounted to the grid and thinned to electron transparency.
Protective coatings are used to reduce #damage to the sample.
The same material (e.g. #Pt ) is also used to "weld" the sample to the needle.
