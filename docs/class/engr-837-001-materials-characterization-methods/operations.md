# Operations
Today, we will convert everything we have learned thus far into practical rules and procedures when using an actual microscope.
Higher mag images become much more tedious, but most imaging is done at lower magnification and not as intensive.



## Objectives
- discuss general user parameters and their importance
- identify the way various control features affect the electron beam and the resulting information



## Comparing contrast images
You can never get rid of topographical contrast.
You can adjust compositional contrast intensity, but never rid the topographical information.

!!! tip Intensity in Contrast Images
    The higher the Z-number for an element (the heavier it is), the brighter the image.



## Operator adjustments to SEM
- There are many possible adjustments available to the user that are not typical in #optical-microscope
- #SEM incorporates numerous detectors, beam energies, apertures, scan speeds, and more
- It is important to know what these do and when to adjust them



## Working distance
One of the most fundamental settings in #SEM is the working distance.
The working distance is the distance form the objective lens exit aperture to the focal point of the beam: also, the surface of the sample, if your sample is in focus.
The longer the working distance will give greater $D_{f}$.
Why?
The screen resolution will also play a role.



## Depth of field
The large $D_{f}$ in #SEM is a consequence of the very small beam size and angle.
The beam is small enough to sufficiently resolve features over a large z-height, especially at low magnification.
The over- and under-focus conditions are still in focus.



## Aperture size
The aperture size determines the convergence angle for any given working distance.
The smallest apertures will yield a greater $D_{f}$ but reduces the overall signal intensity.
The use of a large aperture reduces resolution, but it enables faster analytical results (EDS and EBSD).
Aperture alignment is also important:
- If your image mover laterally as you focus, your aperture is not centered with the beam.
- A focus "wobble"...



## Acceleration voltage and probe current
Higher accelerating voltages reduces the wavelength of electrons (better resolution) and increase probe brightness.
The high voltage results in a larger interaction zone, which reduces lateral resolution.
FEGs are able to provide the high brightness and resolution needed to images are low surface energies.
At low probe current, the gain on the signal amplifier will be excessive and generate noise.

!!! tip At higher voltage, your lose surface detail.



## Astigmatism
Stigmation or simply "stig" adjustment ensures the beam is equiaxed.
This is an essential step in beam focus and is used in tandem with "focus".
The stigmation can be quickly checked by going through...

## Working distance and detector choice
The detector choice will vary with working distance as the signal will be distributed differently.
Not all SEs are the same:
- $SE_{1}$: primary surface signal from inelastic scattering
- 2: SEs created from interactions away from the probe
- 3: SEs created from BSE interactions in the chamber



## Demo time
If you are trying to focus and nothing you do seems to work, then your lens may have a stigmatism.
