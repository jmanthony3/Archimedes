# Interaction Volume

When a high energy beam interactions with a sample surface, many scattering events occur.
This results in a tear-drop or pear-shape zone beneath the surface.
#SE and #BSE are generated throughout, but are dominant at different depths: causing individual [resolution](resolution.md) limits.
X-rays are also produced, but we will discuss those in detail later.

| Notice that the [resolution](resolution.md) is larger with #BSE than from #SE. |
