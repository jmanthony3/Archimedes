# Brightness

Magnification does not produce a good image on its own.
The image formed can be described in terms of its appearance, and is related to the magnification and [NA](numerical-aperture.md).
Brightness is the intensity of light: $$\text{brightness} = \begin{cases}
(NA)^2/M^2 &, \text{Transmission} \\
(NA)^4/M^2 &, \text{Reflection}
\end{cases}$$
At high magnification, the brightness drops rapidly, so a high [NA](numerical-aperture.md) is important.
