# Direct Comparison Method

In a mixture of two phases, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the peak intensities can be compared.
The $\alpha$ phase can be determined by: $I_{\alpha} = K_{2}R_{\alpha}C_{\alpha}/\mu_{m}$.
Where $K$ is separated into the x-ray source contribution, $K_{2}$ and $R_{\alpha}$ is dictated by the #diffraction-angle and #crystallographic properties of the phase, including the structure factor, $F$, unit cell volume, $V$, temperature (in exponential), and the plane multiplicity, $p$: $$R_{\alpha} = \bigg(\frac{1}{\nu^{2}}\bigg)\bigg[\big|F_{hkl}\big|^{2}p\bigg(\frac{1 + \cos^{2}(\theta)}{\sin^{2}(\theta)\cos(\theta)}\bigg)\bigg]e^{-2M}$$
In a cubic crystal, $p$ for ${001}$ is six and ${111}$ is eight.
