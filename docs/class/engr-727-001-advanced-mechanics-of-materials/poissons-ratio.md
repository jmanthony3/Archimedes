# Poisson's Ratio

A body, upon being pulled in tension, tends to contract laterally.
Ergo, there is transverse deformation with longitudinal strain which is defined by Poisson's Ratio, $\nu$:

Poisson's Ratio
: ~$$\begin{equation}
\nu = \frac{\text{lateral strain}}{\text{axial strain}} = -\frac{\epsilon_{y}}{\epsilon_{x}}
\end{equation}$$
Alternatively, in tensor notation:
$$\begin{equation}
\nu = -\frac{\epsilon_{11}}{\epsilon_{33}} = -\frac{\epsilon_{22}}{\epsilon_{33}}
\end{equation}$$

!!! note Common Poisson's Ratio
    Most metal Poisson's Ratio are approximate to each other: $\nu \approx 0.3$.
