# Curved Beam Formula (Winkler's Theory)

Stress distribution is non-linear because the #neutral-axis is non-linear.
The centroid is not the #neutral-axis in a curved beam as was true in a straight beam.
We make the following assumptions:
   1. All cross-sections possess a vertical axis of symmetry lying in the plane of the centroidal axis passing through $C$.
   2. The beam is subjected to end couples, $M$. The #bending moment vector if everywhere normal to the plane of symmetry of the beam. Sections originally plane and perpendicular to the centroidal beam axis remain so subsequent to #bending.
   3. The influence of transverse shear on beam deformation is not taken into account.
      1. Lines $bc$ and $ef$ represent the plane sections before…​.
