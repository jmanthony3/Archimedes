# Moment-Curvature Relationship

The *Moment-Curvature Relationship* for a composite beam of two materials may be determined from the condition that the moment resultant of the behind stresses is equal to the bending moment, $M$ acting at the cross-section.
$$\begin{split}
M &= -\int_{A}\sigma_{x}ydA = -\int_{1}\sigma_{x1}ydA - \int_{2}\sigma_{x2}ydA \\
 &= kE_{i}\int_{1}y^{2}dA + kE_{2}\int_{2}y^{2}dA
\end{split}$$
This last equation relates the #second-moment-of-the-area second moments of the area (the [moment of inertia](../engr-743-001-damage-and-fracture/moment-of-inertia.md)) with respect to the #neutral-axis.
