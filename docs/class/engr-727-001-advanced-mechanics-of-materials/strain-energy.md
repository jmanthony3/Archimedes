# Strain Energy

Energy absorbed by the material during the loading process.
If we assume that the material follows *[Hooke's Law](hookes-law.md)*, then the load-displacement curve is a straight line.
Then the strain energy, *U* stored in the bar (equal to the work, $W$ done by the load) is: $U_{0} = W = \frac{P\delta}{2} = \frac{P^{2}L}{AE}$.
