# Internal Forces

The design of a structure or a mechanical member requires to know the loading acting within the member.

Internal Forces
: Forces acting within a plane when a body is "cut" across some section.

Types of Internal Forces:
1. Normal forces attempt to elongate or compress the body with a force normal to the surface wherein the force acts. $\sum_{z} = 0$, $\int dN = \sigma dA \implies \sigma = \frac{F}{A}$
2. Shear forces acts in-plane to cause bodies to slide past each other. $\tau = \frac{V}{A} = \frac{T\rho}{J}$, where $\tau_{max} = \frac{Tr}{J}$ and $\tau_{rect} = \frac{VQ}{It}$, $Q = A'\bar{y}' \implies (\tau_{rect})_{max} = \frac{3V}{2A}$
3. Torsional moments or torques tend to twist the body aboust some axis perpendicular to the area. $T = \int \rho dF$, where if $\tau = \frac{dF}{dA} \rightarrow dF = \tau dA \implies T = \int\rho\tau d$
4. Bending moments tend to bend the body about an axis within some plane of area in the body. $\sigma_{flexure} = \frac{My}{I}$, where $\sigma_{max} = {Mc}{I}$

Stress
: The representative way in which force is distributed throughout a body.

Torque
: When twisted, the cross-section of a torqued body is assumed to remain plane and the angle of twist is rather small.

Bending
: Here, the cross-section, and consequent loadings, are symmetric.

Shear
: Generally thought to act independent of *bending*; although, this is not actually the case in many conditions.
The distribution of this stress along a cross-section is *parabolic*.

If we cut a body/element along some plane, then we can look at the forces that act within that plane due to external loadings to observe how the material of the component itself reacts to those loadings.
Moments cause the element to bend, and we assume the planes remain plane.
Shear causes the faces of the element to pass laterally to other faces, and we assume that planes remain vertical.
Normal stresses causes the element to change length, and we assume constant volume (#Poissons-Ratio).
