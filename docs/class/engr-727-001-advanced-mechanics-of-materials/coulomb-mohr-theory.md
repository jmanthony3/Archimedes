# Coulomb-Mohr Theory

Three simple tests—​tension, compression, and shear—​define the stress in the body. Failure occurs when one of the circles becomes tangent to the envelope.

| This theory is suggested for brittle materials for which the compressive strength far exceeds the tensile strength. |

[Coulomb-Mohr Failure Criterion](coulomb-mohr-failure-criterion.md)
: ~$$\begin{equation}
n = \frac{\sigma_{ut}|\sigma_{uc}|}{\sigma_{1}|\sigma_{uc}| - \sigma_{ut}(\sigma_{1} + \sigma_{3})}
\end{equation}$$
