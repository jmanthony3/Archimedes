# Airy's Stress Function

Stress Function Technique
: Many engineering, plane-elastic problems can be solved by some method that employs the **Airy's Stress Function** to reduce the general formulation to a single governing equation in terms of a single unknown.

In this approach, the underlying question is: "What if this was dependent on the second derivative of some function?" These equations still satisfy the equations of equilibrium and are substituted into the compatibility equations.
