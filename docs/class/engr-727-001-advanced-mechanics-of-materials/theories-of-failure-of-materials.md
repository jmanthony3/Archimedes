# Theories of Failure of Materials

## Introduction
**#static-load**
Most parts today are designed by people of vast experience with tried and true methods; however, #failure still occurs.
Designs must take into account mechanical limitations by considering uncertainties in measured data and applied loads.
Typically, this is quantified with a #factor-of-safety.
*insert math*

**Designing Under Multi-Axial Stresses**
Most materials will have reported elastic moduli and ultimate strengths; therefore, these are simple parameters to include in designs.

#failure-theories
: Proposed, appropriate means of comparing multi-axial stress states to single strength parameters.

[Failure Criterion](failure-criterion.md)
: Domain by which a materialâ€™s performance of yield or fracture within some stress state.
Which domain is defined by the constraints of the design: yield point, #necking, ultimate, etcetera.
3 types of #mechanical-failure:
    1. Elastic
    2. Plastic deformation
    3. Creep deformation
Because these #stress-state so quickly convolutes the yield point, performing comprehensive experiments to predict every behavior of a material is impossible by the infinite size of the domain.
