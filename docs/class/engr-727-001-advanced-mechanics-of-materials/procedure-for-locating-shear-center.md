# Procedure for Locating Shear Center

1. Determine the principal axes of inertia.
2. Evaluate the #shear-flow acting on the cross-section when #bending occurs about one of the principal axes.
3. Determine the resultant of those forces.
4. The #shear-center is located on the line of action of the resultant. Take the summation of moments with respect to a convenient point.
5. Repeat the process for the other axis.
