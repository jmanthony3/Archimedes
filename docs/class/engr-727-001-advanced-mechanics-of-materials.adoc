== Course Introduction
:subs: 0
:eqs: 0
:figs: 0
We will be looking at 3 underlying principles throughout this course:

. Equilibrium Equations: all forces balanced
. Mechanical Behavior (Constitutive Equations): use stress-strain and force relationships that satisfy certain materials
. Geometry of Deformation (Compatibility of Equations): information throughout the body must fit together with other portions of the body

.Syllabus
[IMPORTANT]
.Final Exam
====
Final exam for graduate students is *open notes*.
====

Dr. Lugo will be assigning the Final Project based on Teams.
Design of Final Project should be validated with experiment.

.Resistance of a Material
[#fig-resistance_of_materials]
.Usually we design for the _yield stress_ of a material because we like linear. Failure depends on your criterion.

.Allowable Stress and Factor of Safety
For example, a home is a multi-physics problem with many design contraints and variables to accomplish the objectives and satisfy the goals that allow one to live in the home.

The *nuclear industry* uses a factor of safety, stem:[FOS = 5].

.Internal Forces
The design of a structure or a mechanical member requires to know the loading acting within the member.

Internal Forces:: Forces acting within a plane when a body is "cut" across some section.

.Types of Internal Forces
. Normal forces attempt to elongate or compress the body with a force normal to the surface wherein the force acts. stem:[\sum_{z} = 0], stem:[\int dN = \sigma dA \implies \sigma = \frac{F}{A}]
. Shear forces acts in-plane to cause bodies to slide past each other. stem:[\tau = \frac{V}{A} = \frac{T\rho}{J}], where stem:[\tau_{max} = \frac{Tr}{J}] and stem:[\tau_{rect} = \frac{VQ}{It}], stem:[Q = A'\bar{y}' \implies (\tau_{rect})_{max} = \frac{3V}{2A}]
. Torsional moments or torques tend to twist the body aboust some axis perpendicular to the area. stem:[T = \int \rho dF], where if stem:[\tau = \frac{dF}{dA} \rightarrow dF = \tau dA \implies T = \int\rho\tau dA]
. Bending moments tend to bend the body about an axis within some plane of area in the body. stem:[\sigma_{flexure} = \frac{My}{I}], where stem:[\sigma_{max} = Mc}{I}]

[#fig-effects_of_internal_forces]
.Types of internal forces visualized.

Stress:: the representative way in which force is distributed throughout a body.

Torque:: When twisted, the cross-section of a torqued body is assumed to remain plane and the angle of twist is rather small.

Bending:: Here, the cross-section, and consuqeunt loadings, are symmetric.

Shear:: Generally thought to act independent of _bending_; although, this is not actually the case in many conditions. The distribution of this stress along a cross-section is _parabolic_.

.General State of Stress
The "stress state" of a point is defined by the stress components acting on this sides of a differential volume that encloses the point.

* The faces of the element are designated by the directions of their normal.
* The single subscript on the normal stress indicates the face on which it acts.

.Plane Stress
[#fig-plane_stress]
.The stresses are acting on one plane. In this state, two faces are of stress.

N_{F}*850 - 200*9.81*1150 &= 0 \\\

\implies F_{CD} &= 2439.5~N
\end{split}
++++

Because the bar stem:[\bar{CD}] is subjected to compressive stresses: stem:[\sigma_{CD} = \frac{F_{CD}}{A} = \frac{2439.5 N}{\frac{\pi}{4}(25 mm)^{2}} = 4.96 MPa].
The factor of safety, stem:[FOS = \frac{\sigma_{y}}{\sigma_{CD}} = \frac{220 MPa}{4.96 MPa} = 44.35] is well above the typical stem:[FOS = 2]; therefore, this piston stem:[\bar{CD}] is over-designed.

The *centroid* and *Moment of Inertia* is determined by:

\begin{split}
\bar{y} &= \frac{A_{1}\bar{y_{1}} + A_{2}\bar{y_{2}}}{A_{1} + A_{2}} \\\

I &= \frac{1}{12}bh^{3} + Ad^{2} \\\

\end{split}

Next, we find the *Bending* stresses:

* Point B
** Top: stem:[\sigma_{B} = \frac{M_{B}C_{1}}{I} = \frac{(2200~lb-ft)(10 - 6.853)~in (12~\frac{in}{ft})}{167.3~in^{4}} = 496.6~psi]
** Bottom: stem:[\sigma_{D} = \frac{M_{D}{C_{2}}}{I} = \frac{(2200~lb-ft)(12~\frac{in}{ft})(6.583~in)}{167.3~in^{4}} = 1081.4~psi]
* Point D
** Top: stem:[\sigma = \frac{M_{D}c_{1}}{I} = \frac{(3800~lb-ft)(12~\frac{in}{ft})(10 - 6.853)~in}{167.3~in^{4}} = 0.858~ksi]
** Bottom: stem:[\sigma = \frac{M_{D}c_{2}}{I} = \frac{(3800~lb-ft)(12~\frac{in}{ft})(6.853~in)}{167.3~in^{4}} = 1.868~ksi]

Finally, we find the *Shear* stresses:

.The maximum shear stress occurs at the distance furthest from the centroid. We will use the lower part of the cross-section for simpler calculations.

[#fig-plane_stress_example_problem_5_cross-section]
.By drawing a cross-sectional element from along bar stem:[\bar{DHB}] of section stem:[\bar{DH}], we see two internal moments and one shear force about the shaft.

M_{z} &= (60~lb)(4~in) \\\

\end{split}
++++

From these moments and shear, we can find the principal stresses at point, stem:[H].
We need the moment of inertia, stem:[I = \frac{\pi d^{4}}{64} = \frac{\pi (0.75~in)^{4}}{64} = 0.0155~in^{4}].
We need, also, the polar moment of inertia, stem:[J = \frac{\pi d^{4}}{32} = 2I = 0.03106~in^{4}].
Therefore, the following applies:

* Bending: stem:[\sigma_{H_{1}} = \frac{M_{z}r}{I} = \frac{(240~lb-in)(\frac{0.75}{2}~in)}{0.0155~in^{4}} = 5.795~ksi]
* Shear: stem:[\tau = \frac{M_{x}r}{J} = \frac{(415.642~lb-in)(\frac{0.75}{2}~in)}{0.03106~in^{4}} = 5.018~ksi]

_Lecture: January 18, 2022_

"Mechanics of Materials is the study of internal forces of a body within a structure."
-- Dr. Lugo

.Internal Forces
If we cut a body/element along some plane, then we can look at the forces that act within that plane due to external loadings to observe how the material of the component itself reacts to those loadings.
Moments cause the element to bend, and we assume the planes remain plane.
Shear causes the faces of the element to pass laterally to other faces, and we assume that planes remain vertical.
Normal stresses causes the element to change length, and we assume constant volume (Poisson's Ratio).

.Stress Equilibrium Equations
[#fig-stress_equilibrium_equations_2d]
.Consider an element of sides stem:[dx] and stem:[dy] of some unit thickness. It is assumed that stem:[\sigma_{x}], stem:[\sigma_{y}], stem:[\tau_{xy}], and stem:[\tau_{yx}] are functions of stem:[x] and stem:[y]. Assume that the stem:[x] and stem:[y] components of the body forces per unit volume, stem:[F_{x}] and stem:[F_{y}].
image::engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/stress_equilibrium_equations_2d_220120_133143_EST.png[caption="Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. ", reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}"]

In mechanics, there are 2 types of forces: external and internal loads.
We often describe these as body forces and remote forces (xref:fig-stress_equilibrium_equations_2d[]).
If we take the sum of the moments about the lower-left corner, then stem:[\sum M_{z} = 0 := (\frac{\partial\sigma_{y}}{\partial y}dxdy)\frac{dx}{2} - (\frac{\partial\sigma_{x}}{\partial x}dxdy)\frac{dy}{2} + (\tau_{xy} + \frac{\partial\tau_{xy}}{\partial x}dx)dxdy - (\tau_{yx} + \frac{\partial\tau_{yx}}{\partial y}dy)dxdy + F_{y}dxdy\frac{dx}{2} - F_{x}dxdy\frac{dy}{2} = 0].
This reduces to stem:[\tau_{xy} = \tau_{yx}].
Similarly, in 3 dimensions, the following can be found stem:[\tau_{yz} = \tau_{zy}] and stem:[\tau_{xz} = \tau_{zx}].
From sum of the stem:[x] forces: stem:[\sum F_{x} = 0 := (\sigma_{x} + \frac{\partial\sigma_{x}\tau_{x}}dx)dy - \sigma_{x}dy + (\tau_{xy} + \frac{\partial\tau_{xy}}{\partial y}dy)dx + \tau_{xy}dx - F_{x}dxdy = 0].
This simplifies to: stem:[(\frac{\partial\sigma_{x}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial\sigma_{x}}{\partial y} + F_{x})dxdy = 0].
Because stem:[dx] and stem:[dy] are non-zero:

[stem, role=center]
++++
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial\sigma_{x}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial\sigma_{x}}{\partial y} + F_{x} &= 0 \\\
\frac{\partial\sigma_{y}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial\sigma_{y}}{\partial x} + F_{y} &= 0
\end{split}
++++

By expanding to 3 dimensions:

[stem, role=center]
++++
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial\sigma_{x}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial\tau_{xy}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial\tau_{xz}}{\partial z} + F_{x} &= 0 \\\
\frac{\partial\sigma_{y}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial\tau_{xy}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial\tau_{xz}}{\partial z} + F_{x} &= 0 \\\
\frac{\partial\sigma_{z}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial\tau_{xy}}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial\tau_{xz}}{\partial z} + F_{x} &= 0
\end{split}
++++

.General State of Stress of a Point
[#fig-stress_equilibrium_equations_3d]
.The stress state of a point is defined by the stress components acting on the sides of a differential volume that encloses the point which requires 9 forces in total.
image::engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/stress_equilibrium_equations_3d_220120_134715_EST.png[caption="Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. ", reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}"]

Often times, we use a matrix to represent these 9 forces: stem:[[\sigma_{ij}\] = \[\tau_{ij}\] = \mathbf{\tau}_{ij} = \bmatrix{\sigma_{x}, \tau_{xy}, \tau_{xz} \\ \tau_{yx}, \sigma_{y}, \tau_{yz} \\ \tau_{zx}, \tau_{zy}, \sigma_{z}}\bmatrix]].
However, we must remember that this matrix is _symmetric_.

.Stress Acting on Arbitrary Planes
[#fig-stress_equilibrium_equations_plane]
.The equations governing the transformation of the stress in 3D are obtained using a similar approach to that applied to the 2D case. Therefore, we can follow a similar manner to consider a tetrahedron isolated from a continuous medium subjected to a general state of stress.

The orientation of plane stem:[ABC] is defined in terms of angles between a unit normal, stem:[n] to the plane and the stem:[x], stem:[y], and stem:[z] directions.
The directions cosines associated with these angles are:

[stem, role=center]
++++
\begin{split}
\cos(\alpha) &= \cos(\mathbf{n}, ) \\\
 &= 
\end{split}
++++

The equilibrium forces can be obtained after canceling the area, stem:[A].
The areas of perpendicular planes stem:[QAB], stem:[QAC], and stem:[QBC] can be expressed in terms of stem:[A], the area of stem:[ABC] and the direction cosines:

[stem, role=center]
++++
\begin{split}
A_{AQB} &= A_{x} = \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{i} = A(l\mathbf{i} + m\mathbf{j} + n\mathbf{k}) \cdot \mathbf{i} = Al \\\
 &= Al \\\
\implies A_{QAC} &= Am \\\
\implies A_{QBC} &= An
\end{split}
++++

Using the stress tensor, we can represent these equilibrium equations by:

[stem, role=center]
++++
\begin{split}
p_{x} &= \sigma_{x}l + \tau_{xy}m + \tau_{xz}n \\\
 &= 
\end{split}

The normal stress, stem:[\sigma] is the projection of the vector, stem:[\vec{p}] in the direction of stem:[\mathbf{n}].

The transformation matrix is composed by the direction cosines: stem:[l_{1} = \cos(x', x), m_{1} = \cos(x', y)], and so on.

In tensor notation: ...

[#fig-stress_transformation_in_cartesian_with_new_axes]
.Using these transformation equations for stresses acting on a new axis, stem:[\vec{p} = [\tau_{ij}\]\vec{n}] on an oblique plane in this new coordinate system becomes stem:[\vec{}' = [\tau_{ij}'\]\vec{n'}].

These vectors can be related by: stem:[\vec{p}' = \vec{T} \cdot \vec{p}].
This can be combined with the transformed stress tensor into: stem:[[\tau_{ij}']\vec{n}' = \vec{T}[\tau_{ij}]\vec{n}].
The relationship between stem:[\vec{n}] and stem:[\vec{n}'] can be obtained by the inversion of stem:[\vec{n}' = \vec{T}\vec{n}] which is stem:[\vec{n} = \vec{T}^{T}\vec{n}'].

The book performs the same derivations with different notation.
Ultimately, these two expressions are equivalent, but the book's notation is longer and more expressive.

.Principal Stress in 3D
Planes with zero shear stress are mutually perpendicular and have a (min)maximum which are called *principal stresses*.
Therefore, the stress vector on principal planes is given by stem:[\vec{p} = \sigma_{p}\vec{n}] where stem:[\sigma_{p}] is the magnitude of the stress vector, stem:[\vec{p}] and stem:[\hat{n} = l\hat{i} + m\hat{j} + n\hat{k}] is the unit normal to a principal plane.
By projecting stem:[\vec{p}] along each axis and substituting into stem:[\vec{p} = \vec{\tau_{ij}}\hat{n}], we arrive to the identity matrix:

...

This becomes an _eigenvalue problem_.
A non-trivial solution for the direction cosines requires that the characteristics stress determinant vanish; therefore, we set this equal to zero.

...

This gives the characteristic equation: stem:[\sigma_{p}^{3} - I_{1}\sigma_{p}^{2} + I_{2}\sigma_{p} - I_{3} = 0]; wherein, stem:[{I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3}}] are the stress invariants.
[stem, role=center]

\begin{split}
I_{1} &= \sigma_{x} + \sigma_{y} + \sigma_{z} \\\
I_{2} &= \sigma_{x}\sigma_{y} + \sigma_{x}\sigma_{z} + \sigma_{y}\sigma_{z} - \tau_{xy}^{2} - \tau_{yz}^{2} - \tau_{xz}^{2} \\\

[IMPORTANT]
.Concerning the resulting forces

These forces are body, not surface forces; therefore, we are findings forces per volume.

\frac{\tau_{xz}}{\partial x} &= z - 4xy \\\
\frac{\tau_{xz}}{\partial z} &= x
\end{split}

[start=2]
. Next, with these derivations and summing the forces in the stem:[x]-direction, we find: stem:[F_{x} := 2(-10) + (-2)(-10)(30) + (-10) + F_{x} = 0 \\ \implies F_{x} = 570~\frac{N}{m^{3}}] Similarly: stem:[F_{y} = 14.5~\frac{kN}{m^{3}}] and stem:[F_{z} = 50.8~\frac{N}{m^{3}}].

.Problem 2: The stress components at a point in a plate are stem:[\sigma_{x} = 80~MPa], stem:[\sigma_{y} = 60~MPa], stem:[\sigma_{z} = \tau_{xy} = 20~MPa], stem:[\tau_{xz} = 40~MPa], and stem:[\tau_{yz} = 10~MPa].

Find stem:[\vec{p}] according to appropriate equations...

[loweralpha, start=2]
. Principal Stresses
We find the stress invariants to be stem:[I_{1} = 160~MPa], stem:[I_{2} = 5500~MPa^{2}], and stem:[I_{3} = 0].
stem:[\therefore], we plug these into the characteristic, cubic equations.
stem:[\sigma_{p}^{3} - 160\sigma_{p}^{2} + 5500\sigma_{p} - 0 = 0 \\ \implies \sigma_{p} = \{0, 110, 50\}~MPa].
We check that stem:[\sigma_{1} \geq \sigma_{2} \geq \sigma_{3}] which maps stem:[\vec{\sigma_{p}}] to stem:[\{110, 50, 0\}~MPa].

[loweralpha, start=3]

[#sec-strain, {counter:secs}, {counter:subs:0}, {counter:eqs:0}, {counter:figs:0}]
== Strain, Deformation, and Mechanical Properties

.Introduction
Most bodies undergo some amount of elastic deformation under some external loading.

Strain:: A geometric quantity that measures the deformation of a body.

This is one of the most important topics in solid mechanics because strain quantifies the changes in geometry during deformation from applied stresses.

Normal Strain, stem:[\epsilon]:: In a direction stem:[\hat{n}], this is defined as the change in length per unit length of the fibers oriented in the stem:[n]-direction.

[stem#eq-strain_avg, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]
++++
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta s' - \Delta s}{\Delta s}
\end{equation}
++++
In solid mechanics, if we consider the deformation of a prismatic bar, then we represent average strain as stem:[\epsilon_{\text{avg}} = \frac{L - L_{0}}{L_{0}} = \frac{\delta}{L_{0}}].

.Pure Shear
Shear strain is allowed by the shear forces balancing each other out on each face of differential elements.

Shear Strain, stem:[\gamma]:: The change in angles between two originally perpendicular line segments.

[qanda, role=center]
Why are there two different notations for normal strain? -- dk::
If you do not have enough information to perform the integral, then you assume the average strain.

.Tension Testing: Mechanical Properties of Materials
This is most important test for us.
Slowly applying axial loads unto a cylindrical bar, the specimen, the strain can be measure for some strain-rate.
Typically, the yield point of a specimen is determined the 0.2%-offset Method.

.Brittle versus Ductile Materials and Elasticity versus Plasticity
[qanda, role=center]
How do we know the difference between brittle and ductile materials? -- Dr. Lugo::
This distinction is subjective, but in general, ductile materials undergo much more plastic strain (absorb more energy) before failure than "brittle" materials.
Typically, this defining limit is held as 5% strain.

If we unload the specimen before the applied stress exceeds the yield point, then the material will elastically return to its original length.
This holds true to viscoelastic materials; however, "visco-" connotes some time-dependence, but, ultimately, the specimen does return to its original geometry.

.Linear Elasticity and Hooke's Law
Most engineering materials have an initially, linear elastic region on the stress-strain diagram.
This linear relationship between stress and strain for a material in simple tension can be expressed by:
[stem#eq-hookes_law, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]
++++
\begin{equation}
\sigma = E\epsilon
\end{equation}
++++
This constitutive relationship is to us what Newton's Second Law of Motion is to physics.

.True Stress-Strain Curve
This differs from engineering strain, which considers that the cross-sectional area remains constant, by considering that the cross-sectional area changes with changes in overall length.
[stem#eq-engineering_stress, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]
++++
\begin{equation}
s = \frac{F}{A_{0}}
\end{equation}
++++
[stem#eq-true_stress, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]
++++
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
\end{equation}
++++
In Advanced Mechanics of Materials, we consider only the elastic region; therefore, stem:[s] and stem:[\sigma] are considered equivalent which is true until sufficient plastic deformation.
stem:[s] and stem:[\sigma] are related by:
[stem, role=center]
++++
\begin{split}
\sigma &= s(1 + e) \\\
\epsilon &= \ln(1 + e)
\end{split}
++++

Strain-Hardening:: True stress increases continuously until sufficient plastic strain allows for the material to begin necking.

.Axially Loaded Members
Axial Deformation:: When axial loads are applied to a member.

We must make key assumptions:

* asdf

By these, we get an equilibrium equation: stem:[\delta = \frac{PL}{AE}].
If the member has regions of different cross-sectional areas and loads applied not only at the ends of the body, then the Law of Superposition can be applied to find total elongation: stem:[\delta = \sum\frac{PL}{AE}].

.Statically Indeterminate Structures
[#fig-statically_indeterminate]
.Considering these two structures, we can solve the left-hand figure by summation of the forces to find the overall deformation. However, the right-hand figure is _statically indeterminate_.
image::engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/statically_indeterminate_220127_140135_EST.png[caption="Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. ", reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}"]
Reactions for the left-hand can be calculated from equilibrium equations, but left-hand cannot be solved this way.
We must also include compatibility equations.

* Equilibrium equations: stem:[\sum F_{x} = R_{A} + R_{c}]
* Constitutive equations: stem:[\delta = \frac{PL}{AE}]
* Compatibility equations: stem:[\delta_{T} = 0]

[#fig-statically_indeterminate_with_superposition]
.We can also use Law of Superposition. We temporarily remove one of the fixed points and consider each region of the body separately with constitutive equations that are coupled together with equilibrium and compatibility equations.
image::engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/statically_indeterminate_with_superposition_220127_140549_EST.png[caption="Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. ", reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}"]

.Thermal Effects on Axial Deformation
Considering a homogeneous bar stem:[\bar{AB}] of uniform cross-section on a smooth, horizontal surface, there is a change in length with change in temperature.
[stem#eq-thermal_effects, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]

We are given the displacements and we want to find stem:[\gamma_{xy}]; therefore, we must find stem:[\theta_{1} = \angle AB] and stem:[\theta_{2} = \angle AD].
[stem, role=center]

We are given the diameter and length of each segment of the bar. The elastic modulus of steel is commonly stem:[200~GPa] and for brass is stem:[101~GPa].
We need to find stem:[\sigma_{st}] and stem:[\sigma_{br}], but this problem is _statically indeterminate_.
We can use the *Law of Superposition* with compatibility and constitutive equations to find the reaction forces at points stem:[C] and stem:[D].
[stem, role=center]

\begin{split}
\delta_{P_{1}} &= \frac{P_{1}L_{AD}}{A_{AD}E_{br}} + \frac{P_{1}L_{AB}}{A_{AB}E_{st}} \\\

\delta_{R_{C}} &= 2\Bigl(\frac{R_{C}L_{AD}}{A_{AD}E_{br}}\Bigr) + \frac{R_{C}L_{AB}}{A_{AB}E_{st}} \\\
 &= 0.00000001048 R_{C}
\end{split}
++++
By the compatibility equations, stem:[\delta_{T} = 0], because both ends of the bar are fixed which is _statically indeterminate_.
[stem, role=center]

\begin{split}
\therefore \delta_{T} = 0 := \delta_{P_{1}} + \delta_{P_{2}} + \delta_{R_{C}} &= 0 \\\
0.0018436 - 0.00018909 + 0.00000001048 R_{c} &= 0 \\\
\implies R_{C} &= 157.88~kN

By sum of the forces, we can find stem:[R_{D} = 107.88~kN].
Therefore, stem:[\{\sigma_{AD}, \sigma_{AB}, \sigma_{BC}\} = \{54.96, 134.025, 80.4\}~MPa].

.Deformation
[#fig-deformation_of_body_under_load]
.Consider body subjected to external loading that has been translated and rotated which can be measured as displacement.

The percentage of this displacement with respect to the body's original position is strain.
There are two methods to measure this displacement: *Lagrangian* and *Eulerian*.
[#fig-strain_defined]
.Normal strain, the unit chage in length, is defined as: stem:[\epsilon_{x} = \frac{\Delta L}{L_{0}}].
image::engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/strain_defined_220203_132613_EST.png[caption="Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. ", reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}"]

.Plane Strain
A 2D case in which all points in the body, before and after loading, remain in the same plane: stem:[\epsilon_{z} = 0], stem:[\gamma_{xz} = \gamma_{yz} = 0].
We assume that the strains in the 3rd direction are infinetesimally small.
Normal and longitudinal strains are given by:
[stem, role=center]
++++
\begin{split}
\epsilon_{x} &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \\\
\epsilon_{y} &= \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}
\end{split}
++++
By making a _small angles assumption_, the angle, stem:[\alpha_{x}] between stem:[AB] and stem:[A'B'] is so small that stem:[AB \approx A'B']:
[stem, role=center]
++++
\begin{split}
\alpha_{x} &\approx \tan\dots \\\
 &= 
\end{split}
++++

.Three-Dimensional Strain
The same principles from 2D are applied 3D but now includes the 3rd component.
[NOTE]
.FEA Codes
====
Most commercial softwares rely on _small angle assumptions_ for their codes. While this assumption is suitable for mosst engineering problems, the codes do also include logic to handle those case with substantial strain.
====
Similar to xref:eq-stress_tensor[], a tensor for the strains can also be made:
[stem#eq-strain_tensor, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]
++++
\begin{equation}
[\epsilon_{ij}] = \begin{bmatrix}
\epsilon_{x} & \frac{1}{2}\gamma_{xy} & \frac{1}{2}\gamma_{xz} \\\
\frac{1}{2}\gamma_{xy} & \epsilon_{y} & \frac{1}{2}\gamma_{xz} \\\
\epsilon_{z} & \frac{1}{2}\gamma_{xy} & \frac{1}{2}\gamma_{xz}
\end{bmatrix}

[stem#eq-green_strain, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\epsilon_{x} &= \frac{(A'B')^{2} - (AB)^{2}}{2(AB)^{2}} \\\
 &= \frac{(dx + \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}dx)^{2} + (\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}dx)^{2} - (dx)^{2}}{2(dx)^{2}} \\\
 &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}\biggl[ \Bigl(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\Bigr)^{2} + \Bigl(\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}\Bigr)^{2} \biggr] \\\
 &= \frac{A'B' - AB}{AB} \\\
\implies \epsilon_{y} &= \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{1}{2}\biggl[ \Bigl(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\Bigr)^{2} + \Bigl(\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}\Bigr)^{2} \biggr] \\\
\gamma_{xy} &= \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + \dots
\end{split}
\end{equation}
++++
The last equation for stem:[\epsilon_{x}] is _engineering strain_.

.Equations of Compatibility
Mathematically, it means that the displacements stem:[u], stem:[v], and stem:[w] satisfy the boundary conditions, are single-valued, and are continuous functions of position.
Physically, this means that the body must be peiced together: no voids are created in the deformed body.
In the tensor notation, we have 3 strain components from 2 displacements (in 2D); therefore, we need a third equation to consider these effects separately.
Kinematic equations connect six components of strain to only three components of displacement.
We cannot, therefore, arbtrarily specify all the strains as functions of stem:[x], stem:[y], and stem:[z].
In 2D strain, differentiation of stem:[\epsilon_{x}] twice wrt stem:[y], ...
[stem#eq-strain_compatibility, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]
++++
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial^{2}\epsilon_{x}}{\partial y^{2}} &= \frac{\partial^{3}u}{\partial x\\partial y^{2}} \\\
\frac{} &= 
\end{split}
\end{equation}
++++
This relation is the condition of compatibility of the 2D problem, expressed in terms of strain.
The equations can be expanded to 3D:

.Deformation in Any Direction
[#fig-deformation_in_any_direction]
.A line segment with infinitesimal unit length is considered, whose orientation in relation to the coordinate axes is defined by the direction cosines: stem:[l], stem:[m], and stem:[n].
image::engr-727-001-advanced-mechanics-of-materials/deformation_in_any_direction_220203_135448_EST.png[caption="Figure {secs}-{counter:figs}. ", reftext="Fig. {secs}-{figs}"]
The components in directions stem:[x] and stem:[y] of the displacement vector may be obtained directly.
In tensor notation, stem:[\begin{bmatrix}\delta_{x} \\\ \delta_{y} \\\ \delta_{z}\end{bmatrix} = {\delta} = \begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{x} \dots \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}l \\\ m \\\ n\end{bmatrix}].
This reduces to stem:[{\delta} = [\epsilon_{ij}\begin{bmatrix}l \\\ m \\\ n\end{bmatrix}]].
Since stem:[\vec{OQ}] has unit length and inly infinitesimal deformations, the longitudinal strain in its direction is obtained by the projection of stem:[\vec{\delta}] in the direction stem:[\hat{n}]: stem:[\epsilon = [\delta\]\cdot \hat{n} = \begin{bmatrix}\delta_{x} \\\ \delta_{y} \\\ \delta_{z}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}l & m & n\end{bmatrix}^{T}].

.Rotation Between Two Line Elements (Shear Strain)
[#fig-rotation_between_two_line_segments]
.Consider two infinitesimal lines segments stem:[PA] and stem:[PB] of length emanating from point stem:[P]. This direction of cosines between lines stem:[PA] and stem:[PB] are () and (), respectively.

Here, the calculations for the dot product between these vectors becomes quite cumbersome:
[stem#eq-shear_strain_between_line_segments, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]
++++
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{12} = 2l_{1}l_{2}\epsilon_{x} + 2m_{1}m_{2}\epsilon_{y} + 2n_{1}n_{2}\epsilon_{z} + 2(l_{1}m_{2} + l_{2}m_{1})\epsilon_{xy} + 2(m_{1}n_{2} + m_{2}n_{1})\epsilon_{yz} + 2(l_{1}n_{2} + l_{2}n_{1})\epsilon_{xz}
\end{equation}
++++

.Transformation of Three-Dimensional Strain
The reference axes of the strain tensor may be transposed by means of the matrix operation.
Using the corresponding stress relation by replacing stem:[\sigma] by stem:[\epsilon] and stem:[\tau] by stem:[\frac{\gamma}{2}].

[#sec-stress-strain, {counter:subs}]
=== Stress-Strain Relationships and Behavior Hooke's Law
.Elastic Deformation: Hooke's Law
We like elastic behaviors because of the linear relationship.
If the strains are small, then plastic deformation is not a major concern.
Most materials exhibit this initial region of elasticity.
[stem, role=center]
++++
\sigma_{x} = E\epsilon_{x},
++++
where stem:[E] is Young's Modulus of Elasticity.
Similarly for shear stresses:
[stem#eq-hookes_law-shear, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]
++++
\begin{equation}
\tau_{xy} = G\gamma_{xy}
\end{equation}
++++

.Hooke's Law and Poisson's Ratio
A body, upon being pulled in tension, tends to contract laterally.
Ergo, there is transverse deformation with longitudinal strain which is defined by Poisson's Ratio, stem:[\nu]:
[stem#eq-poisson_ratio, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]
++++
\begin{equation}
\nu = \frac{\text{lateral strain}}{\text{axial strain}} = -\frac{\epsilon_{y}}{\epsilon_{x}}
\end{equation}
++++

[NOTE]
.Common Poisson's Ratio
====
Most metal Poisson's Ratios are approximate to each other: stem:[\nu \approx 0.3].
====

.Volume Change
By *Law of Conservation of Mass*, there is also a volume change associated with Poisson's Ratio.
[stem, role=center]
++++
\begin{split}
V_{f} &= (1 + \epsilon_{x})dx(1 - \nu\epsilon_{x})dy(1 - \nu\epsilon_{x}dz) \\\
 &= [1 + (\epsilon_{x} - 2\nu\epsilon_{x}\dots)]
\end{split}
++++

.Elastic Deformation under Multiaxial Loads
In the one-dimensional case, Hooke's Law (xref:eq-hookes_law[]) is very simple, and applied loads case linear changes in normal and transverse strains: stem:[\sigma = E\epsilon] and stem:[\tau = G\gamma].
However, these relationships can be expanded into tensor notation:
[stem, role=center]
++++
\begin{bmatrix}\sigma_{x} \\\ \sigma_{y} \\\ \sigma_{z} \\\ \tau_{xy} \\\ \tau_{yz} \\\ \tau_{zx}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
S_{11} & S_{12} & S_{13} & S_{14} & S_{15} & S_{16} \\\
S_{21} & S_{22} & S_{23} & S_{24} & S_{25} & S_{26} \\\

S_{61} & S_{62} & S_{63} & S_{64} & S_{65} & S_{66}
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}\end{bmatrix}
++++
Similarly, a compliance matrix can also be made for the multiaxial strains.

[IMPORTANT]
.Stress-Strain Tensor Notations
====
These tensor define the stress or strain state at that point in the material. Typically, we like to assume materials exhibit _isotropic_ deformation; however, real materials exhibit _anisotropically_.
====

.Isotropic Elastic Materials
A materials mechanically _isotropic_ if all of its mechanical properties are the same in all spatial directions.
In the isotropic case, the constants do not depend on the orientation of the coordinate axes, and most of the constants are either zero or have the same values as other ones.
In a two-dimensional case: stem:[\epsilon_{x} = \frac{\sigma_{x}}{E} - \dots]

.Relationship Between Elastic Constants
If two of the constants stem:[\nu], stem:[E], and stem:[G] are determined experimentally, the third may be found by:
[stem#eq-shear_modulus, reftext="Eq. {secs}-{counter:eqs}", role=center]
++++
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{E}{2(1 + \nu)}
\end{equation}
++++
Alternatively, stem:[\lambda = \frac{\nu E}{(1 + \nu)(1 - 2\nu)}].

.Problem 1: Strains are measured on the surface of a brass alloy part as follows: stem:[\epsilon_{x} = 1600e-6], stem:[\epsilon_{y} = 1300e-6], and stem:[\gamma_{xy} = 1500e-6]. Estimate the in-plane stresses stem:[\sigma_{x}], stem:[\sigma_{y}], and stem:[\tau_{xy}], and also the strain, stem:[\epsilon_{z}] normal to the surface. Assume that the gages were bonded to the metal when there was no load on the part, that there has been no yielding, and that no loading is applied directly to the surface so that stem:[\sigma_{z} = \tau_{yz} = \tau_{zx} = 0].
We are given the strain state and are asked to assume plane-strain conditions.
Before we begin solving the stress state, we must find the material properties for typical brass alloys.
Therefore, if we assume that stem:[E = 110~GPa] and stem:[\nu = 0.3], then stem:[G := \frac{E}{2(1 + \nu)} = ${engr(110e9/(2*(1 + 0.3)))}~Pa].
The compliance matrix:

 &= \begin{bmatrix}9.091 & -2.727 & 0 \\\ -2.727 & 9.091 & 0 \\\ 0 & 0 & 0.2364\end{bmatrix}e-6

.Elasticity
This chapter differs from others because of how we approach problems.
Previously, we assume the stress/strain state and the mode of failure axiomatically by uniform distributions and average stress/strains.
However, in most design studies, machines/equipment is much more complex; therefore, we need the principles of this chapter for more accurate designs.
Typically, these are presented as partial differential equations (PDE).
This requires two or more variables in the problems.
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) allows one to solve for much more complex geometries for the compatibility equations.

.Fundamental Principles
. The general equilibrium equations from a free body diagram (FBD) of a differential, rectenagular element taken from a structural body of any shape/material;
. The strain-displacement equations and the equivalent compatibility equations from the geometry of the deformation of the same element; and, 
. Constitutive equations for isotropic and orthotropic linearly elastic material models.

The 3 sets of equations available apply over the interioir of the structual body and are called the _field_ or _domain equations_.

.Plane Elastic Problems: 2D
Plane Elastic Problems:: Complex, 3D problems can be reduces to 2D problems.

Geometry:: A plane body consists of a region of uniform thickness stem:[t], bounded by two parallele planes, parallel to the stem:[xy]-plane, and by any closed surface.

Plane Stress Problem:: The thickness stem:[t] is small compared to the dimensions in the parallel surfaces.

Plane Strain:: The thickness is large compared to the dimenions in the parallel planes.

.Reduction to Stress Equations
The stress/strain state and geometry must be determined so as to satisfy the strain equations, the stress-strain relationships, and the equilibrium equations as well as the boundary conditions.
The compatibility equation, stem:[\frac{\partial^{2}\gamma_{xy}}{\partial x\partial y} = \frac{\partial^{2}\epsilon_{x}}{\partial y^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{2}\epsilon_{y}}{\partial x^{2}}], must be satisfied for the strain equations.
This equation can be transformed into one equations involving the stress components by subsitituing the stress-strain relationships and equilibrium equations.

Next, the equilibrim equations are differentiated with respect to stem:[x] and stem:[y], respectively, and added to yield: _insert math_

.Comparison of 2D Isotropic Problems
A solution satisfying all these equations is, for a given problem, unique: that is, it is the _only_ solution to the problem.
In the absence of body forces or in the case.

Of the following table, you could solve the problem using one method and transform to the other.

.Airy's Stress Function
Stress Function Technique:: Many engineering, plane-elastic problems can be solved by some method that employs the *Airy Stress Function* to reduce the general formulation to a single governing equation in terms of a single unknown.

In this approach, the underlying question is: "What if this was dependent on the second derivative of some function?"
These equations still satisfy the equations of equilibrium and are substituted into the compatibility equations.

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^{4}\Phi}{\partial x^{4}} + \frac{\partial^{4}\Phi}{\partial x^{2}\partial y^{2}} + \frac{\partial^{4}\Phi}{\partial y^{4}} = \nabla^{4}\Phi = 0

.Solution of Elasticity Problems
* *Inverse method* assumes a solution which must be proven. Best solved by people with much experience with the problem.
* *Semi-inverse method* solves PDE to satsify all conditions of the problem.

Many problems can be solved with _polynomials_ which are much easier to work with.
These assumed polynomials must satisfy the biharmonic equation (xref:eq-biharmonic[]) and be of second degree or higher to yield a non-zero stress solution.
