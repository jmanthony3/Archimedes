## Viscoelasticity
Some phenomenological models try to predict mechanical performance of materials based on behavior observed in a few experiments without consideration of the microstructural physics.
- Ludwik-Hollomann: $\sigma = K\epsilon^{n}$
- Ludwik: $\sigma = \sigma_{0} + L\epsilon^{m}$
- Swift-Griffits: $\sigma = L(\epsilon + \epsilon_{0})^{m}$
- Johnson-Cook: $\sigma = (A + B\epsilon^{n})(1 + C\ln(\dot{\epsilon_{*}})(1 - T_{*}^{m})$
- Voce: $\sigma = A - (A - B)\exp\Big( -\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}} \Big)$

**Kahn 1999 Review**

!!! note
    Dr. Cho does not even read a paper if it directly uses the total strain because that is a low-level, not physics-based model.
    Of course, if you are comparing experimental results, then read the paper.
    But do not read the paper for its lack of contribution to material modeling.

### Modeling
Radial Return (Krieg and Krieg, 1977)

Most models use the von Mises (J2) yield surface in their modeling scheme: including Bammann's ISV model.
