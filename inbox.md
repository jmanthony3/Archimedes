## Dissertation Notes
[[liu2020CriticalMicrostructures]]
: explains that [[recrystallization]] delays [[crack-initiation]] and blocks [[crack-propagation]] by reducing local stresses at grain [[triple-junction]] in the [[heterostructure]].

[[zhang2012InfluenceOfRecrystallization]]
: explains that [[recrystallization]] allows for [[crack-initiation]] at the boundary to the matrix, which further allows for [[intergranular]] [[crack-propagation]] toward the matrix.

[[todaka2004ComparingNanocrystallineSurfaceLayer]]
: depicts that sharp boundaries exist between the [[nanocrystalline-layer]] and the [[recrystallization-layer]] where the material matrix boundary to the [[recrystallization-layer]] occurs further into the material. 

[[liu2020CriticalMicrostructures]] observes a [[heterostructure]] of nickel with [[coarse-grain-zones]] in [[ultrafine-grain-matrix]] and [[zhang2012InfluenceOfRecrystallization]] observes a superalloy of nickel.

## 211012
**Team Council** in *Dean's Conference Room*: 211012

Opening Comments:
- Tate introduces and recaps who we are, what we are responsible for, and goes over meeting outline.

### General Comments
- Minimize joke pictures on whiteboards.
- Present ourselves as the *Engineering department conscience* to the teams because we are first line of defense and first exposure to faculty feedback.
- Students draw to meet the design requirements. Criticism is given and the design is adjusted. During manufacturing, design is assessed for issues and modified as needed.

- Each team needs to be approved near beginning of semester because department (MFH) proposes next calendar year budget at end of October.
- Would be nice if all competition teams had same department deadlines.
- *No cannibalizing of former vehicles. Let us keep retired vehicles from each team at front of department.*
- Dr. Horstemeyer can reallocate money not used from competition teams to other engineering deparment ventures.
- The sooner we can get the forest of design understood, the less problematic the tree steps.
- **Workshop for *Creationeering* with Dr. Horstemeyer.**

### General Questions
- Should conceptual designs occur before the budget proposal? Absolutely.
- Where are each teams on their conceptual designs?
  - Baja: Preliminary (treating vehicle as Conceptual).
  - HPVC: Critical (final).
  - FSAE: planning for conceptual.
  - Rocket: Conceptual.
  - Vanguard: unknown.
- What is required for each design review?
  - Scope for competition
  - Engineering requirements (business presentation)
  - System-level design (objectives and constraints: engineering presentation)
  - Sub-system level design (design variables and their value through the process to quantitatively meet system-level objectives and fit within constraints)
  - Timeline
  - Budget
- Systems engineering (team structure) is laid out according to *Creationeering* framework.

### General Concerns
- **HPVC** is being spoon fed by the Ziebarts; however, not all the other faculty may know what is expected of them.
- The competition teams do their own design: faculty filter the design to meet the engineering design template and process. We can attempt to enforce this with each team, and the enforced date could be uniform across the board despite the varying deadline dates for each team.
- Dr. Medina wants to off-load his competition teams.
- Students do not appear to possess good electrical safety: safety guidelines and standards for each team. This could be realized as subset in a sustainability document: what is next step in the process?
- Each team lead needs to be responsible for their own registration deadlines.
- So far, this design process is failing at the faculty level. Team leads may also be misrepresenting state of meeting strict deadlines: the deadlines kept getting moved. In industry, if deadlines are not met, the money is pulled.
- Students do appear to be taught the tools necessary to sustainable designs: therefore, Dr. Horstemeyer could meet during a convo time with team leads (10/25).

### HPVC
- Splitting into two teams for R&D and competition manufacturing.
- They are fairly well established in government and such.
- Having difficult meeting *Critical Design* deadline because of delay on approval to order waiting to meet with Dean. Dean wants to be involved with each step: 1) Conceptual Design, 2) Preliminary Design, and 3) Critical Design.
- Purchasing during manufacturing--e.g. sandpaper--has been slow: idea exists to give Faculty Advisor a *p-card*. Guestimate needs to be given to Valda to determine allotment.
- Perhaps only Stephen H. could hold a *p-card*; although, he may be difficult to get a hold of. The cardholder could even just buy a VISA gift card.
- Moving to "new" *Hudgins* building is without pressurized air and some rather unprofessional drawings on some of the whiteboards.

### Formula
- Intensely long learning process from unresolved issues.
- Better to move to combustion? Potentially, but this may go against Faculty Advisor. Mechanically, FSAE was ready, but did not compete because *Electrical* was not ready.
- Issues arose from lack of systems integration experience that mostly stemmed from Electrical requirements. However, combustion is an order of magnitude more straightforward.
- *Partner with Hendrick??*
- **Alba was upset that we did not go to competition, and she has explained that most electrical teams do not pass *Tech Inspection*.**
- Eric and Sam will email Dr. Horstemeyer, Faculty Advisor (Dr. Medina), and Team Captains of understanding to move to combustion. Propose that if some want to finish the electrical, fine, and if some want to make the combustion, fine. May be valuable to still experiment with: i.e. mechanically.
- If they want to finish by this year, they must present ASAP for spending money in this academic year.

### Rocket
- $30k is an upcoming expense, but that may not be for a couple more years.

### Baja
- **~~Dr. Medina~~ Dr. Lugo is Faculty Advisor.**
- 16 members were from last year, but 4 of these will graduate this year. These same 4 were on team during COVID.
- Before they can get into a building, they are being asked to design for a 2022-23 competition based from this car.
- Some tension from students because Dr. Medina has yet to respond to emails and attend their *Design Reviews*.
- Finishing the vehicle now allows them to visualize the "Death/Recycling".
- Likely not much money required from this year (21-22), but Dr. Horstemeyer wants to also know the following year's costs (22-23).
