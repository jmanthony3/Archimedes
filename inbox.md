[[liu2020CriticalMicrostructures]]
: explains that [[recrystallization]] delays [[crack-initiation]] and blocks [[crack-propagation]] by reducing local stresses at grain [[triple-junction]] in the [[heterostructure]].

[[zhang2012InfluenceOfRecrystallization]]
: explains that [[recrystallization]] allows for [[crack-initiation]] at the boundary to the matrix, which further allows for [[intergranular]] [[crack-propagation]] toward the matrix.

[[todaka2004ComparingNanocrystallineSurfaceLayer]]
: depicts that sharp boundaries exist between the [[nanocrystalline-layer]] and the [[recrystallization-layer]] where the material matrix boundary to the [[recrystallization-layer]] occurs further into the material. 

[[liu2020CriticalMicrostructures]] observes a [[heterostructure]] of nickel with [[coarse-grain-zones]] in [[ultrafine-grain-matrix]] and [[zhang2012InfluenceOfRecrystallization]] observes a superalloy of nickel.
