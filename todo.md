### My Own Questions
- [ ] Classes
  - [x] ENGR 725 - Continuum Mechanics
  - [x] ?? ENGR 798 - Teaching Practicum || ENGR 987 - Dissertation Research ??
    - [x] Switch these around.
    - [ ] Ask another committee member (Dr. Cho) to help with their course.
  - [x] ENGR 837 - Materials Characterization
  - [ ] **Completed DCP returned by July 1 (Harley, Lillian Mikaela <lmharley@liberty.edu>)!**
- [ ] PhD Timeline
  - [ ] Am I still on track for May '23?
    - [ ] Check if school funding changes if my graduation date changes.
  - [x] Can I propose this summer?

### Summer Goals
#### June
- [ ] Finish Python codes
  - [ ] Can eventually correlate to Sam's measures for time of impact and energy.
- [ ] Write up kinematics journal
  - [ ] MA: Look for a journal specializing in the setup and running of experiments for control process to collect data from high-speed footage.
  - [ ] Frame the article in terms of applying the methods onto non-measurable phenomenon (unlike Sam having actual accelerometer in his striking hammer which would validate the numerical process).
  - [ ] Look to get within 90% of empirical data: be reasonable.
- [ ] Turn the methodology of particle tracking into its own paper.
- [ ] MA: Look into this Dr. Schwera conference
#### July
- [ ] Begin ISV modeling of single-site impacts
  - [ ] modeling of crank-slider mechanism (with ISV-Damage and Recrystallization)
  - [ ] Want f(tube length, angle, ball parameters) --> GUI???
  - [ ] Use Abaqus to find deformation and impact energies.
- [ ] Compile literature review and annotated bibliography
#### August
- [ ] Dissertation Proposal
