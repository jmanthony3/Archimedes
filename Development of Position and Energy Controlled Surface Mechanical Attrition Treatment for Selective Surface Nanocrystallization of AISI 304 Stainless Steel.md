## Opening Comments
Dr. Atwater is proud of Sam as a man of many talents and humble spirit.
Apparently, they are patent pending for the technology from scratch.

## Goal
Study the grain refinement of local recrystallization under each impact site.

## Background
See ENGM310 for anatomy of stress-strain diagram and work hardening.
Strain hardening plastically deforms the material to increase the yield strength for subsequent (un)loading cycles.
Compromise the strength-ductility tradeoff with heterogeneous nanograin materials (HNM).

**The problem: Manufacturing HNMs is very difficult.**

Current techniques have great difficulty to produce nanograins at an industrial scale.

Gradient nanograin structures are a possible solution to produce nanograins at scale.

|:--:|
| There is a lot of potential in SMAT treatment to increase yield strength and preserve ductility. |

### Strengthening mechanisms
Gradient grain structure includes a heterogeneous interface between grains of varying size.
Ashby discovered GNDs at this interface for strain compatibility.
Strain bands are really bad in material because fracture is imminent; however, strain bands can be kept localized to nanograin regions to extend the docility of a material.

### Goals: Position and Energy-Controlled SMAT
1. Apply impact patterns with controlled location and spacing
2. Measure and control the energy of each impact

## Impactor Development
Gas guns are difficult to measure impact energies and aim.
Drop towers are also difficult to aim but also slow.
PECSMAT can produce patterned impacts and is equipped with sensors everywhere for precise readings.

|:--:|
| Energy measurements can be decomposed into plastic and elastic energies based on when the indenter rebounds. |

PECSMAT can correct for pressure on the fly to account for the 10% variation of energy readings.

## Experiments
### Control Against Stainless Steel
Comparison of literature values for strain hardening by other methods validates the sanity of PECSMAT which will not be as strong as SMAT but has greater control over the gradient structure.
EBSD imaging showed high kernel misorientation near the impact surface which indicates a gradient density of GND.

### Vary Specimen Thickness
The thicker the specimen, the less improvement of strength but retained more ductility because gradient structure takes up less of the cross-section, generally.
The thinnest specimen tested (0.6 mm) did not perform the best because the industry-grade sheet metal had porosity measured to 90 microns deep: this is not a great depth, but because the sample is already so thin this is a 30% reduction in volume overall.

|:--:|
| Dimpling observed on the fracture surface of tensile specimens, but cleavage was observed in the same region as the grain refinement under the impact sites. |

### Vary Impact Energy

## Q&A
!!! question Does the depth of repeated impacts affect performance? <cite> MFH
    Sam did not examine the Basuchinger effect, but noted that higher pressure resulted in greater deformation with repeated impacts.

!!! question Did you examine that same mode of failure in unprocessed specimens? <cite> DK
    Fracture mechanisms only present in PECSMAT specimens by conjecture of gradient layer.
    There was some brittle fracture in unprocessed materials, but likely only from impurities from the cold-rolling process and not as significant as in the PECSMAT specimen.

!!! question Was there twinning? <cite> MFH
    Maybe some at the center of the cross-section, but nowhere near as significant for the amount of kernel misorientation.
